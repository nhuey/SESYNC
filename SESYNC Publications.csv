Research that integrates and analyses data from natural and social systems can provide important insight for unravelling the complexity of these dynamics. It is, therefore, a critical step towards the development of evidence‐based, whole‐system management approaches. To examine our ability to influence ecosystems that are behaving in unexpected ways, we explore three prominent cases of “ecological surprise.” We captured the social‐ecological systems (SES) using key variables and interactions from Ostrom's SES framework, which integrates broader ecosystem processes (e.g. climate, connectivity), management variables (e.g. quotas, restrictions, monitoring), resource use behaviours (e.g. harvesting) and the resource unit (e.g. trees, fish, clean water) being managed. Structural equation modelling revealed that management interventions often influenced resource use behaviours (e.g. rules and limits strongly affected harvest or pollution), but they did not have a significant effect on the abundance of the managed resource. Instead, most resource variability was related to ecological processes and feedbacks operating at broader spatial or temporal scales than management interventions, which locked the resource system into the degraded state. Synthesis and applications. Mismatch between the influence of management systems and ecosystem processes can limit the effectiveness of human interventions during periods of ecological surprise. Management strategies should shift from a conventional focus on removal or addition of a single resource towards solutions that influence the broader ecosystem. Operationalizing Ostrom's framework to quantitatively analyse social‐ecological systems using structural equation models shows promise for testing solutions to navigate these events.","2018-05","2020-11-17 20:35:01","2023-12-07 17:41:21","","2135–2146","","5","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XDIDDR7H/Filbee-Dexter et al. - 2018 - Quantifying ecological and social drivers of ecological surprise.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DR67B2A8/Filbee-Dexter et al. - 2018 - Quantifying ecological and social drivers of ecolo.pdf","","2014T9-005; 2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; K:ecological surprise; K:eutrophication; K:fishery collapse; K:mountain pine beetle; K:natural resource management; K:social–ecological systems; K:spatial temporal mismatch; K:structural equation model; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4","","Garcia, Cristina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim was to remove deforestation from the soybean supply-chain and halt one of the main drivers of forest loss in the Amazon biome. In this study, we investigated changes in deforestation at the property-level for the period 2004 to 2014. The objective was to examine direct and indirect deforestation, defined as on-property displacement and cross-parcel displacement deforestation for soybean expansion in the Amazon region of Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state of the Brazilian Amazon. We used publicly available property and land use data to quantify deforestation associated with cropland expansion. Similar to previous studies, we found that direct deforestation for soybean expansion declined following the implementation of the Soy Moratorium. Moreover, our analysis suggest that indirect deforestation occurred already before the implementation of the Soy Moratorium, and decreased following the first period of analyses. However, slight increases of indirect deforestation in the more recent periods, combined with decreasing direct deforestations rendered indirect deforestation to be responsible for more than half of the deforestation associated with soybean expansion. While we acknowledge the overall reduction of deforestation for soybean, our results suggest, given the increasing trends of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2013, to address indirect deforestation within the Soy Moratorium. This may be achieved by zero-property-deforestation commitments and by strengthening the integration between supply-chain actors, the soybean and beef purchasing companies and the federal policies aiming to control deforestation.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:41:20","","377–385","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","58 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Q8P8JRYX/S0264837717306919.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Sustainability; 2016C13-002; 2018PF-038; F:Land & Human Dynamics; K:Deforestation free supply-chain; K:Displacement; K:Forest governance; K:Land use change; K:Leakage; K:Soy Moratorium; K:Sustainable supply-chain; K:Zero-deforestation; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; Year 8 (FG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In higher education, changes in approaches to teaching, learning, and research are needed to address these wicked problems. In particular, bridging disciplinary divides and the divide between research and practice are essential to find feasible solutions. These transformations require engaging practitioners from outside university communities, as practiced in transdisciplinary research.They also require equipping students with the necessary competencies to engage in truly integrative, interdisciplinary work. Although interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary works are on the rise, these approaches still run counter to traditional research practices that necessarily impose boundaries due to the disciplinary structure of most academic institutions, from metrics for success, to the way that we teach. Despite general agreement on the direction the ongoing transformations in society and scholarship should lead, the pedagogical approaches required to achieve this vision have been less defined. Broadly, there is clarity on the need to shift away from the strict lecture-based approach that has been the predominant instructional method in higher education for centuries and toward the increased use of active learning methods, which have been shown to produce better student outcomes. While some instructors continue to see a role for lectures in higher education, the call to move toward active learning has gathered momentum over the last decade, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields such as biology. Within the broad approach of active learning, however, there is less clarity on best practices and methods for teaching about complex environmental problems. The fact that each of our organizations has independently invested in developing case studies and focused our attention on case study teaching is noteworthy: our collective convergence reflects a broader recognition of case studies as a promising approach. As articulated by Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Wil Burns, in the prospectus for this journal, case studies are a natural fit for the inductive way that most students learn. They also promote critical thinking and give students opportunities to practice defining a problem, recognizing stakeholders, and crafting solutions. These are all critical elements for effective teaching about complex environmental problems, and therefore, case studies offer great promise for educating and training environmental problem solvers. In this commentary, we introduce each of our efforts to develop case study teaching materials and pedagogies, and we highlight common challenges, solutions, and lessons learned from our collective experiences in leading our respective initiatives.","2018-04","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:41:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: University of California Press Journals","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H9YRUQ2G/Wei et al. - 2018 - Pursuing the Promise of Case Studies for Sustainab.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HHM75TF8/Pursuing-the-Promise-of-Case-Studies-for.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Year 1; T:Sustainability; reported to NSF; 2017SC-021; C:Case Study; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; F:Support for Teaching & Training; Short Course; T:Education/Pedagogy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assess these generalizations in an evaluation of protected areas in India. The 5% of India officially protected covers most ecoregions and protected areas have been an important reason why India has suffered no documented species extinctions in the past 70 years. India has strong legislation favouring conservation, government investment focused on 50 Tiger Reserves, and government compensation schemes that facilitate local support, all of which brighten future prospects. However, many protected areas are too small to maintain a full complement of species, making connectivity and species use of buffer zones a crucial issue. Conservation success and challenges vary across regions according to their development status. In less developed areas, notably the biodiverse northeast Himalaya, protected areas maintaining the highest biodiversity result from locally-focused efforts by dedicated individuals. Across India, we demonstrate considerable opportunities to increase local income through ecotourism. Our evaluation confirms a lack of data, increasing threats, and the importance of local support. Research on biodiversity in buffer zones, development of long-term monitoring schemes, and assessment of cash and conservation benefits from tourism are in particular need. For policy makers, two main goals should be the development of monitoring plans for ‘eco-sensitive zones' around protected areas, and a strong emphasis on preserving established protected areas.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:30:13","2023-12-07 17:41:20","","114–124","","","237","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","73 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6XXRX9MU/Ghosh-Harihar et al. - 2019 - Protected areas and biodiversity conservation in India.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V5P3B7F2/S0006320719302927.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2018PF-043; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; K:biodiversity; K:Ecotourism; K:Edge expansion; K:Local community; K:Northeast India; K:Tiger Reserves; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We suggest a four-dimensional framework (4P) that includes reporting on dimensions of (1) the Purpose for selecting a PM approach (the why); (2) the Process by which the public was involved in model building or evaluation (the how); (3) the Partnerships formed (the who); and (4) the Products that resulted from these efforts (the what). We highlight four case studies that use common PM software-based approaches (fuzzy cognitive mapping, agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and participatory geospatial modeling) to understand human–environment interactions and the consequences of ecological changes, including bushmeat hunting in Tanzania and Cameroon, agricultural production and deforestation in Zambia, and groundwater management in India. We demonstrate how standardizing communication about PM case studies can lead to innovation and new insights about model-based reasoning in support of ecological policy development.

Most deltas are subjected to extensive human exploitation, which has altered the habitat composition, connectivity and geomorphology of deltaic landscapes. In the Ebro Delta, extensive wetland reclamation for rice cultivation over the last 150 years has resulted in the loss of 65% of the natural habitats. Here, we compare the dynamics of habitat shifts under two departure conditions (a simulated pristine delta vs. the human-altered delta) using the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) under the 4.5 and 8.5 RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) scenarios for evaluating their resilience to RSLR (i.e. resistance to inundation). Results showed lower inundation rates in the human delta (∼10 to 22% by the end of the century, depending on RCP conditions), mostly due to ∼4.5 times lower initial extension of coastal lagoons compared to the pristine delta. Yet, inundation rates from ∼15 to 30% of the total surface represent the worst possible human scenario, assuming no flooding protection measures. Besides, accretion rates within rice fields are disregarded since this option is not available in SLAMM for developed dry land. In the human delta, rice fields were largely shifted to other wetland habitats and experienced the highest reductions, mostly because of their larger surface. In contrast, in the pristine delta most of the habitats showed significant decreases by 2100 (∼2 to 32% of the surface). Coastal infrastructures (dykes or flood protection dunes) and reintroduction of riverine sediments through irrigation channels are proposed to minimize impacts of RSLR. In the worst RCP scenarios, promoting preservation of natural habitats by transforming unproductive rice fields into wetlands could be the most sustainable option.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:30:00","2023-12-07 17:41:19","","1376–1386","","","655","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier B.V.

We illustrate how both benefit from a real-world focus, with multiple examples of trajectories of ITD organizations. Our diverse international experiences demonstrate ways to cultivate appropriate leadership qualities and skills, especially the ability to create and foster vision beyond the status quo; collaborative leadership and partnerships; shared culture; communications to multiple audiences; appropriate monitoring and evaluation; and perseverance. We identified five kinds of resources for success: (1) intellectual resources; (2) institutional policies; (3) financial resources; (4) physical infrastructure; and (5) governing boards.

We show that the distribution of KMD is limited between central Nepal on the east and north-east Afghanistan on the west and is primarily determined by precipitation of driest quarter, annual mean temperature, water vapor, and precipitation during the coldest quarter. Precipitation being the most influential determinant of distribution suggests the importance of pre-monsoon moisture for growth of the dominant vegetation, Himalayan birch Betula utilis and Himalayan fir Abies spectabilis, in KMD's preferred forests.

A range of ESA programs have been developed—including Candidate Conservation Agreements, Safe Harbor Agreements, and a Voluntary Prelisting Conservation Actions policy—to enhance flexibility and encourage voluntary conservation activities. But why would businesses and other private landowners voluntarily engage in proactive conservation efforts above and beyond what is required for ESA compliance?

An increase of forest cover may improve water infiltration and soil hydraulic properties, but little is known about the response and extent to which forest restoration can affect these properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of forest restoration on surface-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and to verify the Ks recovery to the pre-disturbance soil conditions. We sampled field Ks at the surface in Campinas municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil, at 18 plots under three land-cover types: (i) a pasture; (ii) a restored forest using a high-diversity mix of plantings (85 regional native species) of 9 years of age; and (iii) a remnant forest patch. We used the Beerkan method for soil hydraulic characterization. Bulk density (ρb), soil organic carbon content (OC), soil porosity and particle size data were also sampled. We found considerable differences in soil hydraulic properties between land-cover classes. The highest Ks were observed in remnant forest sites and the lowest Ks were associated with pasture sites. The Ks recovery differs markedly between restored forests. Our results strongly suggest that soil attributes and Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and intensity of land use prior to forest restoration. Attention needs to be given to management activities before, during and after forest restoration, especially where the soil is still compacted and Ks is low.","2018-04","2020-11-17 20:34:42","2023-12-07 17:41:19","","453","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; 2014V-033; K:Beerkan method; K:saturated soil hydraulic conductivity; K:soil infiltration; K:soil properties; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Venture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species distribution models typically rely on environmental data when predicting the occurrence of species, neglecting the effect of species' co-occurrences and biotic interactions. Here, we present a new approach that uses Bayesian networks to improve predictions by modeling environmental co-responses among species. For species from a European peat bog community, our approach consistently performs better than single-species models and better than conventional multi-species approaches that include the presence of nontarget species as additional independent variables in regression models. Our approach performs particularly well with rare species and when calibration data are limited. Furthermore, we identify a group of “predictor species” that are relatively common, insensitive to the presence of other species, and can be used to improve occurrence predictions of rare species. Predictor species are distinct from other categories of conservation surrogates such as umbrella or indicator species, which motivates focused data collection of predictor species to enhance conservation practices.","2020-03","2021-01-28 20:29:02","2023-12-07 17:41:18","2021-01-28 20:29:02","3293-3304","","7","10","","","Predictor species","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Authors.

We investigated the use of both hydrologic and social demographic data for flood exposure mapping with Random Forest (RF) regression and classification algorithms trained to predict both parcel- and tract-level flood insurance claims within New York State, US. Topographic characteristics best described flood claim frequency, but RF prediction skill was improved at both spatial scales when socioeconomic data was incorporated. Substantial improvements occurred at the tract-level when the percentage of minority residents, housing stock value and age, and the political dissimilarity index of voting precincts were used to predict insurance claims. Census tracts with higher numbers of claims and greater densities of low-lying tax parcels tended to have low proportions of minority residents, newer houses, and less political similarity to state level government. We compared this data-driven approach and a physically-based pluvial flood routing model for prediction of the spatial extents of flooding claims in two nearby catchments of differing land use. The floodplain we defined with physically based modeling agreed well with existing federal flood insurance rate maps, but underestimated the spatial extents of historical claim generating areas. In contrast, RF classification incorporating hydrologic and socioeconomic demographic data likely overestimated the flood-exposed areas. Our research indicates that quantitative incorporation of social data can improve flooding exposure estimates.","2020-10","2020-11-17 20:30:00","2023-12-07 17:41:18","","111051","","","272","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Academic Press","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; 2020; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; K:Socio-hydrology; 2019PF-048; F:Vulnerability & Risk; K:FEMA; K:Flooding; K:Flooding insurance claims; K:LIS-FLOOD; K:Random forest; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Risk; T:Vulnerability; Year 9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A commonly suggested solution is to use data from species that are closely related or biologically similar to the focal species. This approach assumes that similar species and populations of the same species would have similar demographic rates, an assumption that has yet to be thoroughly tested. In this study, we constructed a Bayesian hierarchical model to predict demographic rates (intrinsic rate of population growth, r; recruit survival; juvenile survival; adult survival; fecundity) based on biological traits and phylogenetic relatedness, using data for 425 plant species. We found generally small effects of species‐level traits (except woody polycarpic species tend to have high adult survival rates that increased with plant height), and a weak phylogenetic signal for four of the five demographic parameters examined. Patterns were stronger in adult survival and fecundity than other demographic rates, however the unexplained variances at both the species and population levels were high for all demographic rates. For species lacking demographic data, our model produced large, often inaccurate, prediction intervals that may not be useful in a management context. Our findings do not support the assumption that biologically similar or closely related species have similar demographic rates, and provide further evidence that direct monitoring of focal species and populations is necessary for informing conservation status assessments.","2018-05","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:41:18","","1290-1300","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 2; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; 2012PF-003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach combines field data with mathematical models: the models separate changes in relative species abundance from changes in interaction preferences (which describe how interaction frequencies deviate from random encounters). The models with the best predictive ability compared to data requirement are those that capture systematic changes in interaction preferences between different habitat types. Our results suggest a viable approach for predicting the consequences of rapid environmental change for the structure of complex ecological networks, even in the absence of detailed, system-specific empirical data. In a changing world, the ability to predict the impact of environmental change on ecological communities is essential.

These public trust principles have informed two centuries of U.S.A. Supreme Court decisions and environmental laws worldwide. Nevertheless numerous populations of large-bodied, mammalian carnivores (predators) were eradicated in the 20th century. Environmental movements and strict legal protections have fostered predator recoveries across the U.S.A. and Europe since the 1970s. Now subnational jurisdictions are regaining management authority from central governments for their predator subpopulations. Will the history of local eradication repeat or will these jurisdictions adopt public trust thinking and their obligation to broad public interests over narrower ones? We review the role of public trust principles in the restoration and preservation of controversial species. In so doing we argue for the essential roles of scientists from many disciplines concerned with biological diversity and its conservation. We look beyond species endangerment to future generations' interests in sustainability, particularly non-consumptive uses. Although our conclusions apply to all wild organisms, we focus on predators because of the particular challenges they pose for government trustees, trust managers, and society. Gray wolves Canis lupus L. deserve particular attention, because detailed information and abundant policy debates across regions have exposed four important challenges for preserving predators in the face of interest group hostility. One challenge is uncertainty and varied interpretations about public trustees' responsibilities for wildlife, which have created a mosaic of policies across jurisdictions. We explore how such mosaics have merits and drawbacks for biodiversity. The other three challenges to conserving wildlife as public trust assets are illuminated by the biology of predators and the interacting behavioural ecologies of humans and predators. The scientific community has not reached consensus on sustainable levels of human-caused mortality for many predator populations. This challenge includes both genuine conceptual uncertainty and exploitation of scientific debate for political gain. Second, human intolerance for predators exposes value conflicts about preferences for some wildlife over others and balancing majority rule with the protection of minorities in a democracy. We examine how differences between traditional assumptions and scientific studies of interactions between people and predators impede evidence-based policy. Even if the prior challenges can be overcome, well-reasoned policy on wild animals faces a greater challenge than other environmental assets because animals and humans change behaviour in response to each other in the short term. These coupled, dynamic responses exacerbate clashes between uses that deplete wildlife and uses that enhance or preserve wildlife. Viewed in this way, environmental assets demand sophisticated, careful accounting by disinterested trustees who can both understand the multidisciplinary scientific measurements of relative costs and benefits among competing uses, and justly balance the needs of all beneficiaries including future generations. Without public trust principles, future trustees will seldom prevail against narrow, powerful, and undemocratic interests. Without conservation informed by public trust thinking predator populations will face repeated cycles of eradication and recovery. Our conclusions have implications for the many subfields of the biological sciences that address environmental trust assets from the atmosphere to aquifers.","2017-02","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:41:17","","248–270","","1","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","67 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; T:Sustainability; T:Conservation; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Venture; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Policy & Regulation; 2014V-026; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:Canis lupus; K:Carnivore; K:endangered species; K:environmental law; K:lethal management; K:policy; K:wolf; T:Governance & Decision Making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, non-fatal damage by seed predators may allow infection by fungi responsible for post-dispersal seed losses. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify pre-dispersal seed predation and fungal infection in a Neotropical tree species, Luehea seemannii, that produces dehiscent fruits and wind-dispersed seeds, and (2) to link pre-dispersal effects on seed quality to seed survival in the soil. To examine how seed predators and fungi influence seed losses, mesh exclosures, fungicide, and the combination of both treatments were applied to separate branches in the canopy of trees in Gamboa and Parque Natural Metropolitano (PNM), Panama. To determine if treatments affect seed viability and survival in the soil, half of the seeds collected from each treatment were buried for 4 weeks in forest soils and subsequently allowed to germinate before and after the breaking of dormancy. Overall, 24 percent of developing fruit were lost to insect attack. In contrast, fungi infected only 3 percent of seeds at the pre-dispersal stage. For seeds germinated directly after collection, fungicide significantly increased germination in the wetter site (Gamboa) but decreased germination in the drier site (PNM). The pre-dispersal insect exclosure treatment increased the fraction of seeds that remained dormant after burial in the soil. This result suggests that exposure to insect predators may cause physical damage to seeds that results in the loss of physical dormancy but does not necessarily increase the susceptibility of seeds to pathogen attack in the soil.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:41:17","","","","6","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JBUHKBLH/1550.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/J8W4PZNQ/Tiansawat et al. - 2017 - Pre-dispersal seed predators and fungi differ in t.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WL5DUP4A/Tiansawat et al. - 2017 - Pre-dispersal seed predators and fungi differ in t.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Postdoc; Year 5; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; 2015PF-016; K:fungal infection; K:physical dormancy; K:predator exclusion experiment; K:seed burial experiment; K:seed predation; K:Tiliaceae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their (semi) permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every five years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of such fisheries closures (“fishing refugia”) in northwest Mexico to hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing as long as initial designs are ecologically ‘good enough’ and supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool’s capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.","2021-05","2021-06-08 20:05:39","2023-12-07 17:41:16","2021-06-08 20:05:39","","","","8","","Front.

The presence of exotic grasses enhances the occurrence of wildfire in landscapes that had not evolved in the presence of fire, leading to high rates of mortality of the native vegetation. Exotic grasses could be more prone to water stress and mortality than the shrubs they replaced and may not establish during drought, facts that are crucial in ecosystems undergoing increased climatic variability. Here, we develop a process-based modelling framework to investigate the complex dynamics resulting from the introduction of exotic grasses under variable climate. We find that the system converges towards different steady states, depending on the magnitude of climatic variability. While in the absence of climate fluctuations the shrubland state is replaced by an exotic grassland, interannual climate variability may inhibit grass invasion and stabilize the shrubland state. However, climatic variability also gives rise to a novel third, unvegetated state, with grass invasion being followed by drought, grass mortality and intense soil erosion. Most of the research on climate change effects on ecosystems has historically concentrated on the ecological impact of shifts in mean climate conditions. This study shows that changes in the variance are also important when shifts in vegetation composition (e.g. species invasions) result in different susceptibility to climatic variability. In the presence of random climate fluctuations, ecosystems can display steady states that differ from those that would exist under a constant climate or with a climate trend.","2016-04","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:41:16","","1496–1506","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/UUWNKDF6/Yu et al. - 2016 - Potential of grass invasions in desert shrublands .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PETUFWT2/eco.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2016; F:Vulnerability & Risk; Fellow; K:climate variability; K:exotic grasses; K:fire cycle; K:invasive species; K:unvegetated state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new framework is used to capture the complex institutional arrangements and interactions existing before and after the polycentric transformation. Unlike many previous polycentricity studies, the present research focuses primarily on the outcomes of the polycentric shift and determines if these correspond to predictions from polycentricity theory. We utilize survey data collected in 2013 from water managers, as well as archival research to interrogate congruence with principles of polycentricity. This study contributes to the broader discussion on polycentricity in two fundamental ways: (i) It documents the functioning of a water management system following a top-down imposed polycentric reform, and (ii) It empirically inspects whether these polycentric reforms have produced benefits predicted by polycentricity theorists, such as experimentation by local water users, increased collective action, and improved coordination between levels of management.","2016-06","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:41:16","","633-658","","4","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/J7B723FR/McCord et al. - 2017 - Polycentric Transformation in Kenyan Water Governa.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MJWHDJ86/psj.html","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; 2016; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014PF-012; K:collective action; K:institutional analysis; K:Kenya; K:polycentricity; K:water governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes can modify water, energy, and carbon balance of the land surface, which can ultimately affect climate. We utilize satellite data to quantify the potential and actual impacts of forest change on land surface temperature (LST) from 2003 to 2013. The potential effect of forest change on temperature is calculated by the LST difference between forest and nearby nonforest land, whereas the actual impact on temperature is quantified by the LST trend difference between deforested (afforested) and nearby unchanged forest (nonforest land) over several years. The good agreement found between potential and actual impacts both at annual and seasonal levels indicates that forest change can have detectable impacts on surface temperature trends. That impact, however, is different for maximum and minimum temperatures. Overall, deforestation caused a significant warming up to 0.28 K/decade on average temperature trends in tropical regions, a cooling up to −0.55 K/decade in boreal regions, a weak impact in the northern temperate regions, and strong warming (up to 0.32 K/decade) in the southern temperate regions. Afforestation induced an opposite impact on temperature trends. The magnitude of the estimated temperature impacts depends on both the threshold and the data set (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat) by which forest cover change is defined. Such a latitudinal pattern in temperature impact is mainly caused by the competing effects of albedo and evapotranspiration on temperature. The methodology developed here can be used to evaluate the temperature change induced by forest cover change around the globe.","2016-12","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:41:16","","14,372–14,386","","24","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","101 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VBENMHHS/Li et al. - 2016 - Potential and Actual impacts of deforestation and .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CK9M9KQN/2016JD024969.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; 2016; K:afforestation; K:deforestation; K:forest cover change; K:global warming; K:land surface temperature; K:potential and actual impacts of deforestation; K:temperature trends; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While climate responses to geoengineering have been studied in detail, the potential biodiversity consequences are largely unknown. To avoid extinction, species must either adapt or move to track shifting climates. Here, we assess the effects of the rapid implementation, continuation, and sudden termination of geoengineering on climate velocities—the speeds and directions that species would need to move to track changes in climate. Compared to a moderate climate change scenario (RCP4.5), rapid geoengineering implementation reduces temperature velocities towards zero in terrestrial biodiversity hotspots. In contrast, sudden termination increases both ocean and land temperature velocities to unprecedented speeds (global medians >10 km yr−1) that are more than double the temperature velocities for recent and future climate change in global biodiversity hotspots. Furthermore, as climate velocities more than double in speed, rapid climate fragmentation occurs in biomes such as temperate grasslands and forests where temperature and precipitation velocity vectors diverge spatially by >90°. Rapid geoengineering termination would significantly increase the threats to biodiversity from climate change.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:16","","475-482","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","76 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; Year 5; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; 2015PF-020; T:Engineering & Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, social interactions between neighbors could affect whether they mimic each other’s yard design, affecting spatial turnover in plant communities. Further, socio-economic differences between neighborhoods might result in distinct plant assemblages across a city. In this paper, we used fieldwork, GIS, and spatial statistics to examine the variability in front yard vegetation—both cultivated and spontaneous plants—in 870 yards in Chicago, Illinois (USA). Our goals were to understand diversity and spatial patterning of plant communities in residential neighborhoods and how they vary with scale, considering alpha, beta, and gamma diversity. We addressed the following questions: (1) How do alpha, beta, and gamma diversity of cultivated and spontaneous plants vary between neighborhoods with different socioeconomic characteristics? (2) Within neighborhoods, do we see spatial autocorrelation in front-yard plant communities? If so, do those spatial patterns affect plant diversity at the neighborhood scale? We found diverse plant communities and distinct spatial patterns across Chicago. Richness and composition of both spontaneous and cultivated plants differed between neighborhoods, with some differences explained by socioeconomic factors such as education. Spontaneous and cultivated plants showed significant spatial autocorrelation, although that spatial autocorrelation generally did not influence neighborhood-scale diversity. Knowledge of these spatial patterns and their socioeconomic drivers could be exploited to increase adoption of environmentally-friendly yard management practices across a city.","2022-12","2022-12-20 15:24:16","2023-12-07 17:41:15","2022-12-20 15:24:16","104663","","","232","","Landscape and Urban Planning","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GYJTYL48/Minor et al. - 2023 - Plant communities in Chicago residential neighborh.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IYD32JA4/S0169204622003127.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; Year 7; T:Ecology; F:Actionable Research; 2017PF-032; 2022; F:Case study collection; K:Contagion; K:Domestic gardens; K:Residential yards and gardens; K:Socio-ecological systems; K:Urban biodiversity; K:Yardscapes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we explored how plant species loss through experimental removal shaped belowground function in ecosystems characterized by different climatic regimes and edaphic properties. We measured plant community composition as well as potential carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and microbial extracellular enzyme activity in soils collected from four unique plant-removal experiments located along an elevational gradient in Colorado, USA. We found that regardless of the identity of the removed species or the climate at each site plant removal decreased the absolute variation in potential N-mineralization rates and marginally reduced the magnitude of N-mineralization rates. While plant species removal also marginally reduced C-mineralization rates, C-mineralization, unlike N-mineralization, displayed sensitivity to the climatic and edaphic differences among sites, where C-mineralization was greatest at the high elevation site that receives the most precipitation annually and contains the largest soil total C pools. Plant removal had little impact on soil enzyme activity. Removal effects were not contingent on the amount of biomass removed annually, and shifts in mineralization rates occurred despite only marginal shifts in plant community structure following plant species removal. Our results present a surprisingly simple and consistent pattern of belowground response to the loss of dominant plant species across an elevational gradient with different climatic and edaphic properties, suggesting a common response of belowground ecosystem function to plant species loss regardless of which plant species are lost or the broader climatic context.","2021-10","2021-10-22 17:52:33","2023-12-07 17:41:15","","","","","","","Ecology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 34618916","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618916","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; 2018PF-043; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; Year 8; T:Ecology; 2021; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:Carbon mineralization; K:ecosystem functions; K:elevational gradient; K:nitrogen mineralization; K:plant removal; K:plant-soil linkages; K:plants; K:soils","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, restoration techniques often alter a site's soil habitat and plant community structure, which affect the activity and composition of microbial communities. Microbial community structure and activity, as a function of soil texture and plant inputs, were studied in soils collected from a restored and a natural tidal freshwater wetland for a period of nine weeks. We expected that increasing the clay content of restored soils from 13% to 20% and 30% would increase soil C retention via sorption and reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. To elucidate the role of plant inputs in shaping the microbial community and function, plant litter with contrasting C-to-nitrogen (N) ratios were added to test the hypothesis that a greater portion of plant leaf-C from the nutrient-poor plant, Phragmites australis, would be mineralized to CO2 and CH4 than the nutrient-rich plant, Peltandra virginica. We also expected P. virginica would support a more abundant and diverse microbial community than P. australis. Unexpectedly, we found that increasing the clay content of restored soils caused a marginal reduction in the total amount of C partitioned as CO2 and CH4, while the nutrient-rich plant, P. virginica, emitted more CO2 and CH4 than the nutrient-poor plant, P. australis. Furthermore, clay and plant leaf litter amendments had a greater impact on the size, diversity, and composition of the microbial population in restored than natural wetland soils. Overall, we found that increasing clay content in a restored wetland had a limited effect on soil C retention. We also discovered that plant litter significantly altered the underlying structure of the microbial community in restored wetland soils, suggesting greater plant diversity may lead to a more stable, resilient microbial community.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:41:15","","107846","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9THQ9PIC/Maietta et al. - 2020 - Plant litter amendments in restored wetland soils .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/58LR7JJ3/S0038071720301437.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; F:Land & Human Dynamics; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:Carbon mineralization; K:biogeochemistry; K:Greenhouse gas; K:Heterotrophic decomposition; K:Organic amendments; K:Soil organic matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, at least 22 α-diversity and 10 β-diversity metrics of community phylogenetic structure can be combined with nine null models (eight for β-diversity metrics), providing 278 potentially distinct approaches to test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion. Selecting the appropriate approach for a study is daunting. First, we describe similarities among metrics and null models across variance in phylogeny size and shape, species abundance, and species richness. Second, we develop spatially explicit, individual-based simulations of neutral, competitive exclusion, or habitat filtering community assembly, and quantify the performance (type I and II error rates) of all 278 metric and null model combinations against each assembly process. Many α-diversity metrics and null models are at least functionally equivalent, reducing the number of truly unique metrics to 12 and the number of unique metric + null model combinations to 72. An even smaller subset of metric and null model combinations showed robust statistical performance. For α-diversity metrics, phylogenetic diversity and mean nearest taxon distance were best able to detect habitat filtering, while mean pairwise phylogenetic distance-based metrics were best able to detect competitive exclusion. Overall, β-diversity metrics tended to have greater power to detect habitat filtering and competitive exclusion than α-diversity metrics, but had higher type 1 error in some cases. Across both α- and β-diversity metrics, null model selection affected type I error rates more than metric selection. A null model that maintained species richness, and approximately maintained species occurrence frequency and abundance across sites, exhibited low type I and II error rates. This regional null model simulates neutral dispersal of individuals into local communities by sampling from a regional species pool.

As socially constructed data, health VGI reflect the people who perceive issues and choose to report them, and the digital systems that structure the reporting process. We propose a conceptual framework that describes the interlocking effects of socioeconomic, behavioral, geographic, and technological processes on VGI accuracy and credibility. GIS and statistical methods are used to analyze social and geographical biases in health-related VGI through a case study of bed bug complaint data from New York City's 311 system. Reports of bed bug infestation from 311 are mapped and modeled to uncover associations with socioeconomic and built environment characteristics. Factors associated with bed bug report credibility are examined by comparing characteristics of confirmed reports with those for reports in which inspectors found no evidence of infestation (negative reports). A multilevel model of credibility incorporating report-, building-, and tract-level variables reveals strong geographical and socioeconomic biases, with negative reports generated more frequently from high-value residential buildings located in high-income neighborhoods with predominately white, non-Hispanic populations. Using 311 data for all bed bug reports, rather than confirmed reports, obscures the burden of these pests in high poverty neighborhoods and diminishes socioeconomic disparities.

It also assessed the key P inflows, outflows, and PUE in the crop-pasture subsystem, livestock subsystem and the overall agricultural production system to present a comparative picture for these systems across various nations. PUE in the overall agricultural production system (averaged as 46% for the selected thirteen nations) is lower compared to the crop-pasture subsystem (averaged as 72%) but is higher than the livestock subsystem (averaged as 18%). Nations with high PUE in the crop-pasture subsystems usually showed high PUE in the overall agricultural production system. The proportional contribution of the livestock subsystem to the PUE of the overall agricultural production system is substantially higher than the crop-pasture subsystem for a number of EU countries (e.g., Netherlands (85%), Norway (84%), Switzerland (80%)), while the contribution of the crop-pasture subsystem is higher for some Asian countries (e.g., Bangladesh (93%) and India (87%)) and USA (80%). This study indicates that there is a high potential for improving PUE in the agricultural production system of Asian countries particularly through diverting manure-bound P from non-agricultural land or unproductive use to agricultural lands. This study suggests that shifting more towards crop production for plant-based food from animal feed/pasture production for animal-based food (meat) could improve PUE in the agricultural production system. Knowledge gaps identified and limitations addressed in this study could be useful for improving future national scale substance flow analyses (SFAs) of P for the better assessment of P flow and PUE in the agricultural production system.","2021-02","2020-12-10 13:19:30","2023-12-07 17:41:13","2020-12-10 13:19:29","107172","","","121","","Ecological Indicators","Phosphorus use efficiency in agricultural systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PEBMUZUZ/Biswas Chowdhury and Zhang - 2021 - Phosphorus use efficiency in agricultural systems.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W9XLMIQX/S1470160X20311110.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2020; Year 7; 2017C17-025; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Crop production; K:Livestock production; K:Material flow analysis; K:Nutrient recycling; K:Phosphorus flow; K:phosphorus use efficiency; T:Food Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Philadelphia Parks and Recreation (Pennsylvania, US) has conducted tree giveaway events for residents since 2012 with the goal of increasing tree canopy. But some residents who register for giveaway events do not follow through and attend the event, creating logistical and planning difficulties that increase program costs. We tested whether phone call reminders could narrow the intention-action gap and increase the likelihood that registered residents attend a yard tree giveaway event. A total of 251 people registered for a spring 2018 giveaway event. Registered participants were randomly assigned to receive either a standard set of email and paper reminders representing normal program operations (126 participants), or to receive up to two phone call reminder attempts in addition to the standard reminders (125 participants). The follow-through (attendance) rate among registered participants who received phone calls was compared to those who did not receive phone calls. The phone calls increased attendance by 16 percentage points, a statistically significant increase. Based on this effect size and time spent making phone calls, staff spent an average of 12.4 min making phone calls per additional attendee. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an experimental approach to facilitate evidence-based decisions in an urban tree planting context. Further research is needed to evaluate the impacts of communication strategies on resident behavior in tree planting and distribution programs.","2019-08","2020-11-17 20:34:33","2023-12-07 17:41:13","","126425","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Urban & Fischer","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H98X5XQA/Hand et al. - 2019 - Phone-call reminders narrow the intention-action gap by increasing follow-through for a residential tree giveaway p.pdf","","no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sociology; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; T:Methods & Methodology; 2017PF-031; K:communication intervention; K:phone-call reminders; K:randomized evaluation; K:residential ecosystems; K:trees; K:urban forestry; K:yard trees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The legal pet trade is now the dominant pathway by which individuals of these species arrive in their non-native locale. Despite its importance, specific factors of pet trade pathway that influence the release (introduction) of exotic reptiles and amphibians have not yet been examined. We set out to identify broadscale and easily measured biological and economic factors that influence the release of these exotic pets by their owners. We hypothesize that biological factors reflect the cost of care, and economic factors reflect the value that owners place on their pet, both of which can influence the probability when a pet is released. We collected life history and economic data on the 1,722 species of reptiles and amphibians sold within the US as pets over the last 18 years. We also compiled a list of pet trade-attributed releases in the US (i.e., all free-living species regardless of whether they successfully established). We used boosted regression trees to correlate species release status with their life-history traits and economic attributes (r2 = 0.51, AUC = 0.89). We found that species with a high probability of being released were imported at higher quantities over our period of record, have a relatively large adult mass and commanded cheaper retail prices. The number imported and price interacted with longevity and adult mass to produce nonlinear increases in release probability. The most important interaction revealed that large-bodied species imported in high quantities have a three times higher release probability compared to large-bodied species imported in lower quantities. Policy implications. Our results provide guidance towards targeting exotic pet reptile and amphibian species that are at a high risk of being released. Species that are both prevalent in the pet trade and large-bodied or long-lived have the highest probability of being released. This will aid in developing education and policy solutions aimed at decreasing the rate at which these pets are released, thus curtailing the invasion process before these species can establish and impacts can occur.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:34:57","2023-12-07 17:41:13","","2632–2640","","6","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","61 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FTYQCT8W/Stringham, Lockwood - 2018 - Pet problems Biological and economic factors that influence the release of alien reptiles and amphibians by.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NWF5STXU/Stringham and Lockwood - 2018 - Pet problems Biological and economic factors that.pdf","","2018; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; 2016C14-002; K:alien species; K:amphibians; K:exotic pet trade; K:introduction probability; K:introduction stage; K:invasions; K:pet releases; K:policy recommendations; K:reptiles; K:trade","","Céline Bellard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Innovations in monitoring technologies and diffusion of social media enable new approaches to estimation of demand. We assess the feasibility of using geo-tagged photographs uploaded to the image-sharing website Flickr and tweets from Twitter as proxy measures for urban trail use. We summarize geo-tagged Flickr uploads and tweets along 80 one-mile segments of the multiuse trail network in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and correlate results with previously published estimates of annual average daily trail traffic derived from infrared trail monitors. Although heat maps of Flickr images and tweets show some similarities with maps of variation in trail traffic, the correlation between photographs and trail traffic is moderately weak (0.43), and there is no meaningful statistical correlation between tweets and trail traffic. Use of a simple log-log bivariate regression to estimate trail traffic from photographs results in relatively high error. The predictor variables included in published demand models for the same trails explain roughly the same amount of variation in photo-derived use, but some of the neighborhood socio-demographic and built-environment independent variables have different effects. Taken together, these findings show that both Flickr images and tweets have limitations as proxies for demand for urban trails, and that neither can be used to develop valid, reliable estimates of trail use. These results differ from previously published results that indicate social media may be useful in assessing relative demand for recreational destinations. This difference may be because urban trails are used for multiple purposes, including routine commuting and shopping, and that trail users are less inclined to use social media on trips for these purposes.","2017-10","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:13","","789–804","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; Pursuit; T:Sociology; T:Methods & Methodology; 2014T10-020; K:Flickr; K:geo-tagging; K:recreation; K:social media; K:trail use; K:transportation; K:Twitter; K:urban areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Establishment of protected areas aims to counteract the loss of habitats and to slow species extinctions. However, many protected areas also include high levels of habitat disturbance and conversion for uses such as cropland. Understanding where and why this occurs may realign conservation priorities and inform protected area policy in light of competing priorities such as food security. Here, we use our global synthesis cropland dataset to quantify cropland in protected areas globally and assess their relationship to conservation aims and socio-environmental context. We estimate that cropland occupies 1.4 million km2 or 6% of global protected area. Cropland occurs across all protected area management types, with 22% occurring in strictly protected areas. Cropland inside protected areas is more prevalent in countries with higher population density, lower income inequality, and with higher agricultural suitability of protected lands. While this phenomenon is dominant in midnorthern latitudes, areas of cropland in protected areas of the tropics and subtropics may present greater trade-offs due to higher levels of both biodiversity and food insecurity. Although area-based targets are prominent in biodiversity goal-setting, our results show that they can mask persistent anthropogenic land uses detrimental to native ecosystem conservation. To ensure the long-term efficacy of protected areas, post-2020 goal setting must link aims for biodiversity and human health and improve monitoring of conservation outcomes in cropland-impacted protected areas.","2021-01","2021-01-25 19:30:41","2023-12-07 17:41:12","2021-01-25 19:30:41","","","4","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 33468666","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4P2JM8SJ/Vijay and Armsworth - 2021 - Pervasive cropland in protected areas highlight tr.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GBRY82QK/Vijay and Armsworth - 2021 - Pervasive cropland in protected areas highlight tr.pdf; ; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8QPG3GCT/e2010121118.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SCI7UHHP/e2010121118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468666; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468666","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2018PF-043; T:Conservation; Year 8; T:Synthesis Research; 2021; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:area-based targets; K:biodiversity management; K:CBD; K:Food security; K:protected areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about how rural populations perceive climatic change impacts or about how social-ecological systems respond to the effects of change. Here, I examine perceptions of climatic change and their effects on social-ecological systems in the Peruvian Southern Andes. Data from interviews and focus groups are used to explain institutional responses to climatic variability based upon perceived effects of climate change. Results show that people perceive glaciers shrinking, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, more extreme temperatures, and shortened rainy seasons. Their responses to these perceived changes range from wetland creation to agriculture calendar modification to irrigation adjustments. Such perceptions of change rely on personal observations and local knowledge, which inform responses; knowledge-based action characterizes resilient systems. This case study supports the conclusion that the resilience of social-ecological systems in the Peruvian Southern Andes is based upon local knowledge and institutions. Thus, strengthening institutions and fostering local knowledge renewal are crucial for systems' sustainability or transformation.","2014-10","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:41:12","","383–400","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Society of Ethnobiology University of Pennsylvania Museum‐MASCA, 33rd and Spruce Streets, Philadelphia, PA 19104","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; T:Sociology; Year 2; Postdoc; 2014; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2012PF-002; K:local knowledge; K:perceptions; K:rural; K:social-ecological systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a socioecological framework designed to synthesize the pesticide-pollinator system and inform future scholarship and action. Our framework consists of three interlocking domains-pesticide use, pesticide exposure, and pesticide effects–each consisting of causally linked patterns, processes, and states. We elaborate each of these domains and their linkages, reviewing relevant literature and providing empirical case studies. We then propose guidelines for future pesticide-pollinator scholarship and action agenda aimed at strengthening knowledge in neglected domains and integrating knowledge across domains to provide decision support for stakeholders and policymakers. Specifically, we emphasize (1) stakeholder engagement, (2) mechanistic study of pesticide exposure, (3) understanding the propagation of pesticide effects across levels of organization, and (4) full-cost accounting of the externalities of pesticide use and regulation. Addressing these items will require transdisciplinary collaborations within and beyond the scientific community, including the expertise of farmers, agrochemical developers, and policymakers in an extended peer community.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:41:12","","1012–1027","","","662","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","122 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/98X7JEX5/S0048969719300166.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2019; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Year 7; T:Ecology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2017C16-006; F:Research Frameworks; K:Bee; K:Ecotoxicology; K:pesticides; K:Risk assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article extends findings from a companion study that systematically reviewed the ID assessment field from 2000 to 2019. Engaging with the same extensive dataset but in a new way, we employ typological analysis and condense 1,006 published assessment designs into just five main assessment approaches called Pathway Profiles. We then tailor assessment guidance to each Pathway Profile, including potential settings in which each could be most useful and ways each could be modified to reduce challenges and increase rigor. Our goal in defining and interacting with the core of the ID assessment field in this way is not only to clarify activity in this vast and disjointed space but also to simplify and facilitate processes of understanding, choosing from, and strategically developing this diverse landscape.

It is the first study to structure its review of interdisciplinary evaluation around the basics of evaluation theory, creating a simplified model of assessment design choices called an assessment pathway. It further stands alone as an extensive systematic review of the interdisciplinary literature uniquely placed within the context of evaluation, encompassing 20 years, 142 studies, 1,006 assessment pathways, and 19,114 data points. Results show that while interdisciplinary assessments to date excel at variation, only 12% of identified pathways contain the minimum elements required to reach an evaluative judgment. Increased attention to evaluation theory can catalyze progress and provide structure and shared language to a highly varied domain.

These changes may affect the suitability of land for food production, implying elevated risks especially for resource-constrained, food-importing countries. We present the evolution of biophysical redundancy for agricultural production at country level, from 1992 to 2012. Biophysical redundancy, defined as unused biotic and abiotic environmental resources, is represented by the potential food production of 'spare land', available water resources (i.e., not already used for human activities), as well as production increases through yield gap closure on cultivated areas and potential agricultural areas. In 2012, the biophysical redundancy of 75 (48) countries, mainly in North Africa, Western Europe, the Middle East and Asia, was insufficient to produce the caloric nutritional needs for at least 50% (25%) of their population during a year. Biophysical redundancy has decreased in the last two decades in 102 out of 155 countries, 11 of these went from high to limited redundancy, and nine of these from limited to very low redundancy. Although the variability of the drivers of change across different countries is high, improvements in yield and population growth have a clear impact on the decreases of redundancy towards the very low redundancy category. We took a more detailed look at countries classified as 'Low Income Economies (LIEs)' since they are particularly vulnerable to domestic or external food supply changes, due to their limited capacity to offset for food supply decreases with higher purchasing power on the international market. Currently, nine LIEs have limited or very low biophysical redundancy. Many of these showed a decrease in redundancy over the last two decades, which is not always linked with improvements in per capita food availability.","2016-05","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:41:11","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; Venture; 2016; Year 3; 2014PF-012; 2014V-029; 2016PF-029; Year 4 (JD); Year 6 (JG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion.

We investigated how dams and hydroclimatic alterations interact with species ecological and life history traits to influence past extirpation probabilities of native freshwater fishes in the Upper and Lower Colorado River (CR), Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT), and Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) basins. Using long-term discharge data for continuously gaged streams and rivers, we quantified streamflow anomalies (i.e., departure “expected” streamflow) at the sub-basin scale over the past half-century. Next, we related extirpation probabilities of native fishes in both regions to streamflow anomalies, river basin characteristics, species traits, and non-native species richness using binomial logistic regression. Sub-basin extirpations in the Southwest (n = 95 Upper CR, n = 130 Lower CR) were highest in lowland mainstem rivers impacted by large dams and in desert springs. Dampened flow seasonality, increased longevity (i.e., delayed reproduction), and decreased fish egg sizes (i.e., lower parental care) were related to elevated fish extirpation probability in the Southwest. Sub-basin extirpations in the Southeast (ACT n = 46, ACF n = 22) were most prevalent in upland rivers, with flow dependency, greater age and length at maturity, isolation by dams, and greater distance upstream. Our results confirm that dams are an overriding driver of native fish species losses, irrespective of basin-wide differences in native or non-native species richness. Dams and hydrologic alterations interact with species traits to influence community disassembly, and very high extirpation risks in the Southeast are due to interactions between high dam density and species restricted ranges. Given global surges in dam building and retrofitting, increased extirpation risks should be expected unless management strategies that balance flow regulation with ecological outcomes are widely implemented.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:41:11","","1175-1185","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; F:Built Environment; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; Year 6; 2016PF-025; K:biodiversity loss; K:dams; K:flow regime; K:global change; K:imperiled species; T:Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing studies are limited by their short temporal scales and limited spatial extent. We analyzed two sediment cores spanning the last two millennia from the northern (Laguna Piñan) and southern (Laguna Fondococha) Andean páramo of Ecuador to provide a longer-term perspective on lake dynamics. Both lakes show shifts in the dominant diatoms through time. Fondococha diatoms shifted in dominance between two Aulacoseira species and in the planktic to benthic ratio, and these shifts are interpreted as evidence of changing lake level. The inferred shifts are corroborated by changes in sediment geochemistry. Piñan shows a directional shift in the diatom assemblage over the period of the record, from benthic diatoms tolerant of high dissolved organic carbon (DOC), low pH, and low nutrients, to an assemblage characteristic of lower DOC, Melina use only one higher for pH, nutrients and lake levels. Shifts in Piñan’s diatoms are correlated with tephra layers in the sediment, suggesting that local volcanic deposition may have been responsible for altering the catchment and lake geochemistry. This is supported by relatively high δ13C values in organic matter associated with tephra layers, which become more negative up-section. Our study suggests that remote lakes in spatially heterogenous montane regions act as sentinels of different facets of environmental change and provide insights into Andean ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations.","2023-01","2023-01-17 16:36:14","2023-12-07 17:41:10","2023-01-17 16:36:13","","","","","","J Paleolimnol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; 2023; K:Diatoms; K:Ecuador; K:Geochemistry; K:Neotropics; K:Planktic: benthic ratio; K:Tropical mountain lakes; K:XRF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspection of imports is one safeguard for reducing pest introductions, but capacity constraints limit inspection effort. We develop an optimal sampling strategy to minimize the costs of pest introductions from trade by posing inspection as an acceptance sampling problem that incorporates key features of the decision context, including (i) simultaneous inspection of many heterogeneous lots, (ii) a lot-specific sampling effort, (iii) a budget constraint that limits total inspection effort, (iv) inspection error, and (v) an objective of minimizing cost from accepted defective units. We derive a formula for expected number of accepted infested units (expected slippage) given lot size, sample size, infestation rate, and detection rate, and we formulate and analyze the inspector's optimization problem of allocating a sampling budget among incoming lots to minimize the cost of slippage. We conduct an empirical analysis of live plant inspection, including estimation of plant infestation rates from historical data, and find that inspections optimally target the largest lots with the highest plant infestation rates, leaving some lots unsampled. We also consider that USDA-APHIS, which administers inspections, may want to continue inspecting all lots at a baseline level; we find that allocating any additional capacity, beyond a comprehensive baseline inspection, to the largest lots with the highest infestation rates allows inspectors to meet the dual goals of minimizing the costs of slippage and maintaining baseline sampling without substantial compromise.","2018-03","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:41:10","","603–619","","3","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 28846812","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7END926A/Chen et al. - 2018 - Optimal Inspection of Imports to Prevent Invasive .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/AGFNKPXB/risa.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Pursuit; T:Economics; Year 1; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Disease & Pests; 2012T2-003; K:Acceptance sampling; K:Biological invasions; K:biosecurity; K:inspection; K:live plant imports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sampled the beetle from uncultivated Solanum host plants in Mexico, and from pest and non-pest populations in the United States and used mitochondrial DNA and nuclear loci to examine three hypotheses on the origin of the pest lineages: 1) the pest beetles originated from Mexican populations, 2) they descended from hybridization between previously divergent populations, or 3) they descended from populations that are native to the Plains states in the United States. Mitochondrial haplotypes of non-pest populations from Mexico and Arizona differed substantially from beetles collected from the southern plains and potato fields in the United States, indicating that beetles from Mexico and Arizona did not contribute to founding the pest lineages. Similar results were observed for AFLP and microsatellite data . In contrast, non-pest populations from the states of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas were genetically similar to U.S. pest populations, indicating that they contributed to the founding of the pest lineages. Most of the pest populations do not show a significant reduction in genetic diversity compared to the plains populations in the United States. We conclude that genetically heterogeneous beetle populations expanded onto potato from native Solanum hosts. This mode of host range expansion may have contributed to the abundant genetic diversity of contemporary populations, perhaps contributing to the rapid evolution of climate tolerance, host range, and insecticide resistance.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:41:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Agriculture; T:Ecology; T:Disease & Pests; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:invasion biology; K:phylogeography; K:population genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plight of African vultures exemplifies these challenges due to environmental contaminants and other stressors acting on individuals and populations that are already threatened or endangered. Many of these threats emanate from increasing human population size and settlement density, habitat loss from changing land use for agriculture, residential areas, and industry, and climate-related changes in resource availability. Environmental chemicals that are hazardous include legacy chemicals, emerging chemicals of concern, and high-volume-use chemicals that are employed as weed killers and in other agricultural applications. Furthermore, there are differences in risk for species living in close proximity to humans or in areas affected by habitat loss, climate, and industry. Monitoring programs are essential to track the status of nesting pairs, offspring survival, longevity, and lifetime productivity. This is important for long-lived birds, such as vultures, that may be especially vulnerable to chronic exposure to chemicals as obligate scavengers. Furthermore, their position in the food web may increase risk due to biomagnification of chemicals. We review the primary chemical hazards to Old World vultures and the interacting stressors affecting these and other birds. Habitat is a major consideration for vultures, with tree-nesters and cliff-nesters potentially experiencing different risks of exposure to environmental chemicals. The present review provides information from long-term monitoring programs and discusses a range of these threats and their effects on vulture populations.

The objective of this paper is to assist in choosing, for a given ABM, the most appropriate methods of SA. We argue that no single SA method fits all ABMs and that different methods of SA should be used based on the overarching purpose of the model. For example, abstract exploratory models that focus on a deeper understanding of the target system and its properties are fed with only the most critical data representing patterns or stylized facts. For them, simple SA methods may be sufficient in capturing the dependencies between the output-input spaces. In contrast, applied models used in scenario and policy-analysis are usually more complex and data-rich because a higher level of realism is required. Here the choice of a more sophisticated SA may be critical in establishing the robustness of the results before the model (or its results) can be passed on to end-users. Accordingly, we present a roadmap that guides ABM developers through the process of performing SA that best fits the purpose of their ABM. This roadmap covers a wide range of ABM applications and advocates for the routine use of global methods that capture input interactions and are, therefore, mandatory if scientists want to recognize all sensitivities. As part of this roadmap, we report on frontier SA methods emerging in recent years: a) handling temporal and spatial outputs, b) using the whole output distribution of a result rather than its variance, c) looking at topological relationships between input data points rather than their values, and d) looking into the ABM black box; finding behavioral primitives and using them to study complex system characteristics like regime shifts, tipping points, and condensation versus dissipation of collective system behavior.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:41:09","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; K:agent-based modeling; 2020; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; K:mixed methods; K:agent-based models; K:individual-based model; K:mixed methods approach; K:review; K:sensitivity analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the data suggest that BMPs were generally effective on average, removal efficiencies of ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and total nitrogen (TN) were highly variable ranging from negative (i.e., BMPs acting as sources of N) to 100%. For example, removal of NO3 varied from (median ±1 SD) −15 ± 49% for dry ponds, 32 ± 120% for wet ponds, 58 ± 210% for wetlands, and 37 ± 29% for swales. Across the same BMP types, TN removal was 27 ± 24%, 40 ± 31%, 61 ± 30%, and 50 ± 29%. NH4 removal was 9 ± 36%, 29 ± 72%, 31 ± 24%, and 45 ± 34%. BMP size, age, and location explained some of the variability. For example, small and shallow ponds and wetlands were more effective than larger, deeper ones in removing N. Despite well-known intra-annual variation in N fluxes, most measurements have been made over short time periods using concentrations, not flow-weighted N fluxes. Urban N export is increasing in some areas as large storms become more frequent. Thus, accounting for the full range of BMP performance under such conditions is crucial. A select number of long-term flux-based BMP studies that rigorously measure rainfall, hydrology, and site conditions could improve BMP implementation.","2014-12","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:41:08","","1594–1607","","6","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","69 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Synthesis Research; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Pollution; T:Engineering & Design; 2014; K:urban areas; K:best management practices; K:constructed wetland; K:detention pond; K:nitrogen removal; K:nutrients; K:performance; K:retention basin; K:stormwater management; K:vegetated swale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dilution effect hypothesis, which points to decreases in biodiversity as critical to an increase in infection risk, has received considerable attention due to the allure of a win-win scenario for conservation and human well-being. Yet some empirical data suggest that the dilution effect is not a generalizable phenomenon. We explore the response of pathogen transmission dynamics to changes in biodiversity that are driven by habitat loss using an allometrically scaled multi-host model. With this model, we show that declining habitat, and thus declining biodiversity, can lead to either increasing or decreasing infectious-disease risk, measured as endemic prevalence. Whether larger habitats, and thus greater biodiversity, lead to a decrease (dilution effect) or increase (amplification effect) in infection prevalence depends upon the pathogen transmission mode and how host competence scales with body size. Dilution effects were detected for most frequency-transmitted pathogens and amplification effects were detected for density-dependent pathogens. Amplification effects were also observed over a particular range of habitat loss in frequency-dependent pathogens when we assumed that host competence was greatest in large-bodied species. By contrast, only amplification effects were observed for density-dependent pathogens; host competency only affected the magnitude of the effect. These models can be used to guide future empirical studies of biodiversity-disease relationships across gradients of habitat loss. The type of transmission, the relationship between host competence and community assembly, the identity of hosts contributing to transmission, and how transmission scales with area are essential factors to consider when elucidating the mechanisms driving disease risk in shrinking habitat.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:41:08","","","","1722","372","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/I8ILJ2MB/Faust et al. - 2017 - Null expectations for disease dynamics in shrinkin.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438921","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Year 1; F:Land & Human Dynamics; F:Biodiversity; K:biodiversity; T:Ecology; Venture; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Risk; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2012V-009; T:Disturbance; K:allometry; K:amplification effect; K:Animals; K:Communicable Diseases; K:dilution effect; K:Disease ecology; K:ecosystem; K:habitat loss; K:Humans; K:infectious disease dynamics; K:multi-host","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These altered nutrient inputs affect plant communities by generally increasing dominance and reducing diversity, as well as altering community variability (heterogeneity). Less well studied are the effects of changes in community variability on ecosystem functions, such as productivity, or the stability of those functions. Here, we use a twelve-year nutrient addition experiment in tallgrass prairie to determine the variability in community responses to N and P additions and link these responses to ecosystem productivity and stability. We added two levels of N and four levels of P in a fully factorial design to 25-m2 plots in native tallgrass prairie in north-eastern Kansas, USA. Each year percentage cover of each species was measured in June and August in a 1-m2 subplot of each plot, and annual net primary productivity was measured in two 0.1-m2 subplots in each plot at the end of each growing season. The addition of N and P together increased plant community variability across space (i.e. the replicates were significantly more different from each other in the N + P treatments than they were in the control treatment). We also found that the variability of the plant community within a single plot through time increased with the addition of N alone and N and P together. The highest level of both spatial and temporal variability occurred in plots with the highest level of nutrient addition (10 g m−2 of both N and P). While we found no linkage between spatial variability of community composition and the spatial stability of productivity, the temporal stability of productivity decreased with increasing temporal plant community variability. Additionally, the ability to predict the productivity response to growing season precipitation, a key environmental variable, also decreased under higher temporal community variability. Synthesis. Using a 12-year nutrient addition experiment, we found that nutrient addition leads to both spatial and temporal community variability in mesic tallgrass prairie. The changes in community variability through time were directly related to ecosystem stability. While overall shifts in community structure in response to nutrient additions are important, the change in variability of local communities has significant implications for our ability to predict how patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem function will respond to a rapidly changing world.","2016-09","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:08","","1478–1487","","5","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IESKJIX4/Koerner et al. - 2016 - Nutrient additions cause divergence of tallgrass p.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HAWTBXKB/1365-2745.html","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2016; T:Pollution; 2015PF-018; K:ANPP; K:community dynamics; K:convergence; K:dispersion; K:grassland; K:heterogeneity; K:nitrogen; K:phosphorus; K:plant population; K:productivity; K:stability; K:variability","","Jason Fridley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This represents an opportunity to examine the relationship between long-term population changes and shoreline change. Based on detailed land change data for the period 1932–2010 and a small area population estimation technique for the period 1940–2010, we examine intra-parish population changes in relation to shoreline changes for the one million plus residents living in the ten coastal parishes of Louisiana. We find that since 1940, only two of the ten coastal parishes exhibited landward population movement, which we define as movement perpendicular to the shoreline, exceeding 1 km. Three parishes exhibited seaward population movement in excess of 1 km. Overall, we find very little net intra-parish landward population movement for the region. Our findings suggest that coastal Louisiana's historical population has not moved in concert with observed shoreline encroachment. We also find a potential tipping point related to population migration when a neighborhood loses at least 50% of its land area. Our findings suggest that this lack of landward population movement could be attributable to either localized adaptation strategies or migrations to other landward areas.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:41:08","","369-387","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6Z8RWAR4/Hauer et al. - 2019 - No landward movement examining 80 years of popula.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; K:adaptation; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; Year 6; 2016PF-028; K:coastal populations; K:Hurricane Katrina; K:landward migration; K:Louisiana; K:migration; K:sea level rise; K:sea-level rise; T:Coasts & Shorelines; wrong DBI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Catchment partnerships are often thought able to achieve this, so here we ask: do such partnerships actually help navigate complexity, or merely add to it? We answer this question by analysing the experiences of four voluntary UK catchment partnerships. Our data combined a structured desk-based analysis of partnership documents, with semi-structured interviews with partnership coordinators, chairs and partner representatives. These data were analysed using a qualitative thematic approach informed by the literatures on catchment management and collaborative governance of complexity. We found that partnerships both add to and help navigate the complexity of holistic and inclusive environmental management. Maintaining partnerships entails costs for partners, and partnerships connect messily and multitudinously to other initiatives. However, the partnerships were all judged as worthwhile, and made progress towards goals for water quality, biodiversity and river restoration. They were especially valued for envisioning and initiating complex activities such as Natural Flood Management. Communication and networking by partnership coordinators and partners underpinned these achievements. Aspects of pre-existing governance systems both enabled and constrained the partnerships: in particular, statutory agencies responsible for policy delivery were always important partners, and delivering partnership plans often depended on public-sector grants. This draws attention to the pervasive effect of governmentality in collaborative governance. More attention to analysing—and supporting—such partnerships is worthwhile, complemented by reflection on the limits to environmental governance in the face of complexity.","2023-07","2023-07-26 14:12:52","2023-12-07 17:41:07","2023-07-26 14:12:52","","","","","","Sustain Sci","Navigating or adding to complexity?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QBMGGQLX/Waylen et al. - 2023 - Navigating or adding to complexity Exploring the .pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 1; Foundation; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2023; 2012F-002; K:Catchment management; K:Coordination; K:Integration; K:Nature-based solutions; K:Systems approaches; K:Wicked problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New methods for modelling species distributions include the effects of biotic interactions alongside more commonly used abiotic variables such as temperature and precipitation; however, it is not clear which types of interspecific relationship contribute to shaping species distributions and should therefore be prioritized in models. Even if some interactions are known to be influential at local spatial scales, there is no guarantee they will have similar impacts at macroecological scales. Here we apply a novel method based on information theory to determine which types of interspecific relationship drive species distributions. Our results show that negative biotic interactions such as competition have the greatest effect on model predictions for species from a California grassland community. This knowledge will help focus data collection and improve model predictions for identifying at-risk species. Furthermore, our methodological approach is applicable to any kind of species distribution model that can be specified with and without interspecific relationships.","2018-11","2021-01-29 15:44:14","2023-12-07 17:41:07","2021-01-29 15:44:14","","","11","14","","Biology Letters","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Royal Society","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/AX9MKVEN/Staniczenko et al. - 2018 - Negative biotic interactions drive predictions of .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KHHZ4JUU/Staniczenko et al. - 2018 - Negative biotic interactions drive predictions of .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VJRDJWRE/rsbl.2018.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Ecology; 2016PF-027; K:species distribution models; Year 6; K:biotic interactions; K:minimum description length principle; K:model selection; K:normalized maximum likelihood; K:species geographical ranges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual growth and mortality rates largely result from the interaction between an organism's phenotype and the abiotic and biotic environment. Functional traits have been used extensively over the past decade to elucidate links among phenotypes, demography and community dynamics. A fundamental weakness of most functional trait approaches is the use of ‘soft’ traits associated with resource acquisition to examine how neighbourhood similarity affects tree survival and growth. However, these ‘soft’ traits are unlikely to be good predictors of similarities among co-occurring species. Less easily measured aspects of organismal function – such as those related to defence – have frequently gone unmeasured. This is particularly problematic for testing important hypotheses in forest ecology, such as the Janzen–Connell hypothesis where focal trees are expected to be at a disadvantage if their neighbours share the same natural enemies. A potential alternative to functional trait approaches is to quantify the transcriptomic or functional genomic similarity of species. Such analyses are now possible in natural systems where de novo transciptome assemblies can be used to conduct functional phylogenomic analyses where homologous gene trees are produced. Using demographic plot data for 21 species from a North American forest dynamic plot, we conduct a community functional phylogenomic analysis of a plant community to elucidate the similarity in defence response genes across species. This similarity was then used to ask whether the similarity in defence genes of heterospecific species in the local neighbourhood of a focal individual tree influences its growth and mortality rates. The results show that individual growth rates are higher when surrounded by dissimilar heterospecific species for 16 of 27 defence genes analysed. Additionally, survival rates are increased when an individual is in a neighbourhood with dissimilar species for 4 of the 27 defence genes studied. Lastly, strong conspecific effects were found in all analyses, underscoring that future analyses investigating the genetic variation and differential expression of defence-related genes in neighbourhoods may prove important. Synthesis. In summary, this research leverages recent advances in RNA sequencing and bioinformatics to conduct community-wide transcriptomic analyses and analyses of defence-related gene similarity across a tree community. The results demonstrate that defence gene similarity in neighbourhoods often does have negative effects on individual demographic performance as predicted by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:41:07","","616–626","","3","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FJXKP9YY/Zambrano et al. - 2017 - Neighbourhood defence gene similarity effects on t.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ENCCX3BH/1365-2745.html","","2017; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Ecology; 2015PF-017; K:community genomics; K:defense; K:functional phylogenomics; K:Janzen–Connell hypothesis; K:neighborhood; K:neighborhood model; K:neighbourhood model; K:R Gene; K:transcriptome; K:tree demography","","F.

The contingency framework has implications for invasive species management more generally, as well as other conservation issues featuring dynamic spatial ecological processes.","2016-09","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:41:07","","699-707","","6","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308727696_Network_Governance_for_Invasive_Species_Management","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Ecology; F:Actionable Research; 2016; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; K:invasive species; 2013PF-007; K:networks; K:cooperation; K:ecosystem engineers; K:ecosystem management; K:environmental policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior work has demonstrated how drug trafficking catalyzes forest loss and smallholder dispossession but does not make clear the extent to which the long-term control of land is moved from state, Indigenous, or smallholders to criminal or other actors. This study attempts to describe those shifts. Specifically: we develop a typology of land control, and use it to track how drug trafficking initiates shifts from public lands and Indigenous territories to private large holdings. We examine an array of secondary sources indicating shifts in land control related to narcotrafficking, including illegal land seizure documents, news media, and surveys of land managers. In absence of formal land registries, frontier actors may signal their control over land through land use change. After establishing where changes in land control have taken place, we analyzed land use and resulting changes in spatial patterns of forest loss. We found that large scale sustained forest losses (over 713,244 ha and 417,329 ha), in Guatemala and Honduras, respectively, from 2000–2019) corresponds with areas undergoing shifts in control towards large landowners, often related to narcotrafficking. Incomplete empirical data on land control prevent comprehensive attribution of all sustained forest loss related to narcotrafficking. Yet the limited evidence gathered here indicates drug trafficking activities initiate widespread and sustained shifts and consolidation of who controls land and resources at the frontier. Our work suggests that in Central America and likely elsewhere, control over land—quite separate from property rights—is the key factor in understanding social and ecological change.","2021-10","2021-10-21 14:20:06","2023-12-07 17:41:06","2021-10-21 14:20:06","132–159","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","en","Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

Combining planting payments and donations, the survey indicated U.S. households valued monarchs as a total one-time payment of $4.78–$6.64 billion, levels similar to many endangered vertebrate species.

Yet, most research on the effects of global change on coral reefs focus on one or few stressors and pathways or outcomes (e.g. bleaching).

Using ethnographic and remote‐sensing methods, we describe narco‐cattle ranching's money‐laundering practices, its territorial dynamics, and its environmental impacts. We draw on theorisations of “political forests” to explain how drug trafficking organisations transform land use in the reserve, and along the way, remake its ecology, territories and subjects.

Dangerous combinations of pesticides, plant-produced compounds and antibiotics added to hives may cause or contribute to losses, but it is very difficult to test the many combinations of those compounds that bees encounter. We propose a mechanism-based strategy for simplifying the assessment of combinations of compounds, focusing here on compounds that interact with xenobiotic handling ABC transporters. We evaluate the use of ivermectin as a model substrate for these transporters. Compounds that increase sensitivity of bees to ivermectin may be inhibiting key transporters. We show that several compounds commonly encountered by honey bees (fumagillin, Pristine, quercetin) significantly increased honey bee mortality due to ivermectin and significantly reduced the LC50 of ivermectin suggesting that they may interfere with transporter function. These inhibitors also significantly increased honey bees sensitivity to the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid. This mechanism-based strategy may dramatically reduce the number of tests needed to assess the possibility of adverse combinations among pesticides. We also demonstrate an in vivo transporter assay that provides physical evidence of transporter inhibition by tracking the dynamics of a fluorescent substrate of these transporters (Rhodamine B) in bee tissues. Significantly more Rhodamine B remains in the head and hemolymph of bees pretreated with higher concentrations of the transporter inhibitor verapamil. Mechanism-based strategies for simplifying the assessment of adverse chemical interactions such as described here could improve our ability to identify those combinations that pose significantly greater risk to bees and perhaps improve the risk assessment protocols for honey bees and similar sensitive species.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:05","","e0148242","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Ecology; 2016; K:pesticides; K:bees; K:death rates; K:drug interactions; K:enzymes; K:honey bees; K:insecticides; K:metabolism","","Eric Jan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Territoriality, an essential characteristic of many wildlife species, plays a crucial role in the population dynamics of tigers. However, previous models of tiger population dynamics have not adequately incorporated territoriality. We therefore developed and implemented a spatially explicit agent-based model of tiger population dynamics shaped by different territorial behaviors of males and females. To allow for predictions to new conditions, for which no data exist, territories are not imposed but emerge from the tigers' perception of habitat quality and from their interactions with each other. Tiger population dynamics is deduced from merging territory dynamics with observed demographic rates. We apply the model to Nepal's Chitwan National Park, part of a global biodiversity hotspot and home to a large (∼125) population of tigers. Our model matched closely with observed patterns of the real tiger population in the park, including reproduction, mortality, dispersal, resource selection, male and female land tenure, territory size and spatial distribution, and tiger population size and age structure. The ultimate purpose of the model, which will be presented in follow-up work, is to explore human-tiger interactions and assess threats to tiger populations across contexts and scales. The model can thus be used to better inform decision makers on how to conserve tigers under uncertain and changing future conditions.","2015-09","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:41:05","","347–362","","","312","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Z88WGKUT/Carter et al. - 2015 - Modeling tiger population and territory dynamics u.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2015; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; K:Carnivore; Year 3; 2013PF-009; K:Agent-based models; K:Population dynamics; K:population ecology; K:Territory; K:Tiger","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sclerophyllous evergreen forest of central Chile, known as matorral, has been extensively overgrazed by domestic livestock. As a consequence, the native and endemic species of this forest community have been replaced by a savanna-type environment dominated by the species Acacia caven, known as espinales. It has been hypothesized that the collapse of matorral forest can be abrupt, and the two ecosystems represent two alternative stable states. To understand the ecological dynamics that occur during this transition, their signature in space, and the consequences of livestock management, a cellular automata model that considers the local interaction among forest vegetation, Acacia, and livestock management was developed. By simulating and analyzing the process of fragmentation in space and time, in a gradient of livestock pressure and aridity, the results show that the system exhibits properties of ""robust criticality"", with a shift of patch-size distributions from models matching power-laws to models matching truncated power-laws as livestock pressure increases nearby the point of collapse. Simulation results in scenarios with rotation of livestock at the tipping point reveal the interaction between resting frequency and forest conservation. These results provide information to design better management strategies in human-modified landscapes in the remaining Chilean matorral.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:30:28","2023-12-07 17:41:05","","115–123","","","388","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LE3KTQXD/Baeza - 2018 - Modelling the critical transition from Chilean evergreen forest to savanna Early warning signals and livestock management.pdf","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 3; wrong DBI; 2013PF-008; K:Alternative ecosystem states; K:Ecosystem shift; K:Matorral; K:Robust criticality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study addresses factors affecting the parasite's distribution and projects its potential future distribution, using Hawaii as a model for its global expansion. Specimens of 37 snail species from the Hawaiian Islands were screened for the parasite using PCR. It was present on five of the six largest islands. The data were used to generate habitat suitability models for A. cantonensis, based on temperature and precipitation, to predict its potential further spread within the archipelago. The best current climate model predicted suitable habitat on all islands, with greater suitability in regions with higher precipitation and temperatures. Projections under climate change (to 2100) indicated increased suitability in regions with estimated increased precipitation and temperatures, suitable habitat occurring increasingly at higher elevations. Analogously, climate change could facilitate the spread of A. cantonensis from its current tropical/subtropical range into more temperate regions of the world, as is beginning to be seen in the continental USA.","2018-06","2020-11-17 20:35:05","2023-12-07 17:41:05","","1–8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V94TGCTC/Kim et al. - 2019 - Modelling the distribution in Hawaii of Angiostron.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; T:Ecology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; K:invasive species; T:Disease & Pests; 2014T8-017; K:Angiostrongylus; K:climate; K:emerging infectious disease; K:habitat suitability; K:nematode; K:rat lungworm; K:snails","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that in order to understand the dynamics of either system, Earth System Models must be coupled with Human System Models through bidirectional couplings representing the positive, negative, and delayed feedbacks that exist in the real systems. In particular, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates, such as United Nations population projections. This makes current models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real Earth–Human system, especially those that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes, and thus requiring different policy interventions from current models. The importance and imminence of sustainability challenges, the dominant role of the Human System in the Earth System, and the essential roles the Earth System plays for the Human System, all call for collaboration of natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers in multidisciplinary research and modeling to develop coupled Earth–Human system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures to benefit current and future generations.","2016-12","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:41:04","","nww081","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Sustainability; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; 2016; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Fellow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the limited primary sources, historians have argued both for and against the ""maximalist narrative"" of plague, i.e. that the Justinianic Plague had universally devastating effects throughout the Mediterranean region during the sixth century CE. Using primary sources of one of the pandemic's best documented outbreaks that took place in Constantinople during 542 CE, as well as modern findings on plague etiology and epidemiology, we developed a series of dynamic, compartmental models of disease to explore which, if any, transmission routes of plague are feasible. Using expected parameter values, we find that the bubonic and bubonic-pneumonic transmission routes exceed maximalist mortality estimates and are of shorter detectable duration than described by the primary sources. When accounting for parameter uncertainty, several of the bubonic plague model configurations yielded interquartile estimates consistent with the upper end of maximalist estimates of mortality; however, these models had shorter detectable outbreaks than suggested by the primary sources. The pneumonic transmission routes suggest that by itself, pneumonic plague would not cause significant mortality in the city. However, our global sensitivity analysis shows that predicted disease dynamics vary widely for all hypothesized transmission routes, suggesting that regardless of its effects in Constantinople, the Justinianic Plague would have likely had differential effects across urban areas around the Mediterranean. Our work highlights the uncertainty surrounding the details in the primary sources on the Justinianic Plague and calls into question the likelihood that the Justinianic Plague affected all localities in the same way.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:30:03","2023-12-07 17:41:04","","","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2020; T:Disease & Pests; K:death rates; 2018PF-040; 2019PF-045; K:Bubonic plague; K:Epidemiology; K:fleas; K:historians; K:pandemics; K:plagues; K:pneumonic plagues; T:Environmental History; T:Humanities; Year 8 (LW); Year 9 (LM)","","David A.

We developed a model that builds an interdisciplinary understanding of the structure and function of narco-trafficking networks and their coevolution with interdiction efforts as a complex adaptive system. The model produced realistic predictions of where and when narco-traffickers move in and around Central America in response to interdiction. The model demonstrated that narco-trafficking is as widespread and difficult to eradicate as it is because of interdiction, and increased interdiction will continue to spread traffickers into new areas, allowing them to continue to move drugs north. Counterdrug interdiction efforts designed to seize or disrupt cocaine shipments between South American source zones and US markets remain a core US “supply side” drug policy and national security strategy. However, despite a long history of US-led interdiction efforts in the Western Hemisphere, cocaine movements to the United States through Central America, or “narco-trafficking,” continue to rise. Here, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), called “NarcoLogic,” of narco-trafficker operational decision making in response to interdiction forces to investigate the root causes of interdiction ineffectiveness across space and time. The central premise tested was that spatial proliferation and resiliency of narco-trafficking are not a consequence of ineffective interdiction, but rather part and natural consequence of interdiction itself. Model development relied on multiple theoretical perspectives, empirical studies, media reports, and the authors' own years of field research in the region. Parameterization and validation used the best available, authoritative data source for illicit cocaine flows. Despite inherently biased, unreliable, and/or incomplete data of a clandestine phenomenon, the model compellingly reproduced the “cat-and-mouse” dynamic between narco-traffickers and interdiction forces others have qualitatively described. The model produced qualitatively accurate and quantitatively realistic spatial and temporal patterns of cocaine trafficking in response to interdiction events. The NarcoLogic model offers a much-needed, evidence-based tool for the robust assessment of different drug policy scenarios, and their likely impact on trafficker behavior and the many collateral damages associated with the militarized war on drugs.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:41:04","","201812459","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: National Academy of Sciences","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PUGRDKBK/Magliocca et al. - 2019 - Modeling cocaine traffickers and counterdrug inter.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IP7UDKR5/7784.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936311","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 5; 2019; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2015C12-030; K:Agent-based models; K:drug policy reform; K:illicit economy; K:illicit supply networks; K:transaction costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we present the case of a group of rural communities in a semi-desert region of Chile, where cooperation in the form of labor-sharing has helped maintain higher agriculture yields, group cohesion, and identity. Today, these communities face the challenge of adapting to recurrent droughts, extreme rainfall, and desertification. We formulated an agent-based model to investigate the consequences of regional climate changes on the fate of these labor-exchange institutions. The model, implemented in the framework of prospect theory, simulates the economic decisions of households to engage, or not, in labor-sharing agreements under different scenarios of water supply, water variability, and socio-environmental risk. Results show that the number of fulfilled labor-sharing agreements is reduced by water scarcity and environmental variability. More importantly, defections that involve non-fulfillment of these agreements are more likely to emerge at the intermediate level of environmental variability and water supply stress. These results underscore the need for environmental policy instruments that consider the effects of regional climate changes on the social dynamics of these communities.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:41:04","","1161-1172","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Climate Change; T:Sociology; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; Year 3; K:cooperation; K:Agent-based models; 2013PF-008; K:drought; K:labor-sharing; K:Rainfall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, results from our model of Bangladesh suggest counterintuitively that people will continue to migrate toward the vulnerable coastline irrespective of the flooding amplified by future SLC under all emissions scenarios until the end of this century. We developed an empirically calibrated agent-based model of household migration decision-making that captures the multi-faceted push, pull and mooring influences on migration at a household scale. We then exposed ∼4800000 simulated migrants to 871 scenarios of projected 21st-century coastal flooding under future emissions pathways. Our model does not predict flooding impacts great enough to drive populations away from coastlines in any of the scenarios. One reason is that while flooding does accelerate a transition from agricultural to non-agricultural income opportunities, livelihood alternatives are most abundant in coastal cities. At the same time, some coastal populations are unable to migrate, as flood losses accumulate and reduce the set of livelihood alternatives (so-called ‘trapped’ populations). However, even when we increased access to credit, a commonly-proposed policy lever for incentivizing migration in the face of climate risk, we found that the number of immobile agents actually rose. These findings imply that instead of a straightforward relationship between displacement and migration, projections need to consider the multiple constraints on, and preferences for, mobility. Our model demonstrates that decision-makers seeking to affect migration outcomes around SLC would do well to consider individual-level adaptive behaviors and motivations that evolve through time, as well as the potential for unintended behavioral responses.","2021-02","2021-06-11 18:21:07","2023-12-07 17:41:03","2021-06-11 18:21:07","024045","","2","16","","Environ.

This project is unique in that we then used this model to develop not just curricula but also a framework that can be used to guide and assess interdisciplinary instruction at the collegiate level.

Regardless of whether these problems arise in the context of energy, food, or water supply, climate change, urbanization, or other pressing concerns, they involve interconnected economic, sociocultural and environmental components. These sustainability challenges also present unique leadership and research opportunities for higher education. How can universities respond? At one level, academia has already risen to this challenge. In fact, an entirely new field—sustainability science—was launched in 2001 via a landmark paper in Science (Kates et al., 2001), and over 20,000 scientific papers have been published since 1974 that include the words “sustainability” or “sustainable development” in their titles (Bettencourt and Kaur, 2011). Given the complex and stubborn nature of sustainability problems, however, many critics have argued that the traditional academy lacks an effective institutional structure and culture for accelerating progress towards sustainability (Hoffman et al., 2015; van der Leeuw et al., 2012; Whitmer et al., 2010). To counter these concerns, a number of universities have launched bold new initiatives to tackle sustainability problems. In the U.S. alone, recent investment in such programs exceeds $500 million. In addition to their focus on specific sustainability problems, these initiatives are serving as “laboratories” in which to learn how higher education can become an effective societal partner in addressing a wide range of sustainability challenges. Our purpose in this commentary is to highlight some common themes and instructive insights that are emerging from our experiences leading such initiatives in highly diverse university settings. We draw on our presentations at the “What are the Roles of Knowledge Institutions in Sustainability?” symposium at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The AAAS symposium brought together for the first time the leaders of sustainability initiatives at six diverse US academic institutions.[1] We were joined by an eminent audience that included Robert Kates, senior author of the seminal paper framing the emerging field of sustainability science, and Anthony Cortese, co-founder of the nation’s largest network of universities committed to sustainability. Our commentary focuses on five emerging lessons that reflect the challenges in the design and implementation of six different sustainability programs. We augment our views with those of senior leaders (e.g. chancellors, presidents, and provosts) at our respective institutions, which provides a broader basis for reflecting on these lessons. Because these shared insights emerged despite our very different institutions—dissimilar in history, organization, size, and resources—they are potentially relevant for many other institutions seeking to grow the capacity and societal value of sustainability research programs.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:03","","000090","","0","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: University of California Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/786EBZJK/Hart et al. - 2016 - Mobilizing the power of higher education to tackle.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DXVH29BQ/Mobilizing-the-power-of-higher-education-to-tackle.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Sustainability; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; F:Support for Teaching & Training; T:Education/Pedagogy; 2016; K:Higher education; K:higher education innovation; K:institutional change; K:problem-solving","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Place-based analyses of land and livelihood system sustainability must then consider both proximate and distant influences on local decision-making. Thus, advancing land change theory in the context of economic globalization calls for a systematic understanding of the general processes as well as local contingencies shaping local responses to global signals. Synthesis of insights from place-based case studies is a path forward for developing such systematic knowledge. This paper introduces a generalized agent-based modeling framework for model-based synthesis to investigate the relative importance of structural versus agent-level factors in driving land-use and livelihood responses to changing global market signals. Six case-study sites that differed in environmental conditions, market access and influence, and livelihood settings were analyzed. Stronger market signals generally led to intensification and/or expansion of agriculture or increased non-farm labor, while changes in agents' risk attitudes prompted heterogeneous local responses to global market signals. These results demonstrate model-based synthesis as a promising approach to overcome many of the challenges of current synthesis methods in land change science and identify generalized as well as locally contingent responses to global market signals.","2015-09","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:41:03","","807–841","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KWYUKT27/htm.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Economics; 2015; T:Sociology; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; C:Case Study; T:Synthesis Research; K:Agent-based models; K:agent-based synthesis system; K:effect size; K:land-use change; K:livelihoods; K:meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially the case for wicked problems like nonpoint source water pollution where there are compelling questions regarding how best to design policies, allocate funds, and build administrative capacity to meet water quality standards. We present an agent-based model (ABM) of water governance for the Lake Champlain Basin to simulate the impacts of alternative collaborative governance arrangements on the development of suites of water quality projects. The ABM is connected or coupled with land use and phosphorus load accumulation models that are informed by existing hydrologic models, project datasets, and state-set load reduction targets. We find that regionally arranged collaborative governance in water quality project planning and implementation can lead to better water quality outcomes, thereby affirming one of the central premises of collaborative governance regime theory. We also find that externally mandated collaboration, as opposed to voluntary, self-initiated collaboration, can lead to better water quality outcomes, adding to our understanding of which type of collaborative governance arrangement is best suited to the specific contexts of this case. Further, without adequate administrative capacity in the form of human resources located in central network actors to manage project funds, “administrative bottlenecks” may form and money can go unspent. This research demonstrates the efficacy of using simulations of alternative institutional design for theory testing and tuning, and policy prototyping.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:41:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; 2020; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Pollution; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:Agent-based models; 2016C15-013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the ability to sample temporary habitats can be a logistical challenge due to the capability to measure and predict the timing, intensity and frequency of wet-dry events. Unsurprisingly, published datasets on microbial community structure and function are limited in scope and temporal resolution and vary widely in the molecular methods applied. We compared environmental and microbial community datasets for permanent and temporary tributaries of two different North American headwater stream systems: Speed River (Ontario, Canada) and Parkers Creek (Maryland, USA). We explored whether taxonomic diversity and community composition were altered as a result of flow permanence and compared community composition amongst streams using different 16S microbial community methods (i.e., TRFLP and Illumina MiSeq). Contrary to our hypotheses, and irrespective of method, community composition did not respond strongly to drying. Microbial community composition was related to site rather than drying condition. Additional network analysis on the Parkers Creek dataset showed that community composition shifted only slightly in response to temporary stream drying and microbial co-occurrence data indicated a shift in the central microbial relationships. We compared our results with existing published studies from around the world and found a wide range in community responses to drying. We conclude by proposing three hypotheses that may address contradictory results and, when tested across systems, may expand understanding of the responses of microbial communities in temporary streams to natural and human-induced fluctuations in flow-status and permanence.","2015-06","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:41:02","","522","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2015; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; GRA; K:bacterial diversity; K:microbial ecology; K:operational taxonomic unit (OTU); K:temporary streams","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meta-studies of land use change impacts focus mostly on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, while meta-studies of socioeconomic consequences are rare. Land use change processes and land use change impacts are generally addressed in isolation, while only few studies considered trajectories of drivers through changes to their impacts and their potential feedbacks. We provide a conceptual framework for linking meta-studies of land use change processes and impacts for the analysis of coupled human-environmental systems. Moreover, we provide suggestions for combining meta-studies of different land use change processes to develop a more integrated theory of land use change, and for combining meta-studies of land use change impacts to identify tradeoffs between different impacts.

Specifically, in coastal farmlands, we expect SWI to drive changes in plant species composition and carbon (C) storage. As soils salinize, standard crops (i.e., corn, soybean, and wheat) can no longer survive and farmers must consider alternatives. Further, transitioning agricultural fields may become C sinks as SWI advances inland and farmlands begin to resemble tidal wetlands. My objectives were to determine: (1) the effect of SWI on the germination of standard and alternative crop species, and (2) the C storage potential of salt-intruded farmlands. Most standard and alternative crops were intolerant to high levels of osmotic and ionic stress at the germination stage. However, sorghum and salt-tolerant soybean showed promise in field experiments. I show that agricultural fields exposed to SWI have a high potential to store C in soils.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:30:01","2022-05-12 14:40:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Maryland, College Park","College Park, MD","","","masters thesis","","","","","DOI: 10.13016/HNCM-TPH1","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2019; K:ecosystem functions; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Coasts & Shorelines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frank Golley was a champion in developing and implementing ecosystem concepts based on “nature-centered thinking.” His environmental ethics-based principles emphasized “connectedness” among people and their environment that included the value of cultural differences in responding to natural and human-driven disturbances. Golley concluded that long-term, large-scale international studies are essential in evaluating the vulnerability of species and their habitats as well as ecosystem processes. Some ecological disturbances are easy to observe (e.g., floods, fires, hurricanes) while others (e.g., gradual loss of species, slow spread of invasive species) take longer to study but most require long-term research before their full impacts are known. Moreover, cumulative effects and indirect effects of complex interactions require multi-disciplinary research to sort out the causes and effects of changing ecosystem structure and function, often at a global scale. Research in tropical ecosystems demonstrated the need for organizing site-based research for extensive comparative studies. Golley’s international leadership accelerated progress in enhancing the understanding of how these long-term changes in tropical rainforests and agroecosystems can affect local populations and global connections with other ecosystems. Today ongoing studies of both wet and dry tropical forests are providing important data related to ecosystem services needed by local communities. Golley’s linking of ecosystem ecology, landscape ecology, and environmental ethics helped to define pragmatic sustainable “response systems” as a way to resolve complex tradeoffs among conflicting perspectives and his approach can continue to help develop ideas for Earth stewardship.","2015-01","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2022-05-11 19:16:35","","431–450","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-12133-8_29","","","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; 2016; Fellow; K:ecosystem services; T:Humanities; K:agroecosystems; K:environmental ethics; K:long-term ecological research; K:stewardship; K:tropical rainforests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An ecosystem service thus represents a type of transaction between natural capital and humans and can be considered within tools to support Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) decision making. A natural capital perspective can be a useful way to put the value of ecosystems on par with other socioeconomic values in an EBM decision context. Further, the application of structured classifications for ecosystem components, human beneficiaries (users), and a suite of flows of final ecosystem services helps EBM practitioners organize information for a given decision context. This chapter explores the utility of natural capital accounting as a tool for EBM, outlines a standardized framework for natural capital accounting, and summarizes an ecosystem services classification system for natural capital accounting that can be used as an EBM tool, especially relevant for the decision-making step of evaluating management options (e.g., scenarios). Lessons Learned • The organizational structure of the National Ecosystem Services Classification System (NESCS) allows for the determination of environmental and valuation measures and metrics using classes and sub-classes specific enough that they minimize the possibility of double counting specific ecosystem service flows, an important criterion for establishing the creditability of ecosystem services assessments. • The format of a NESCS code is WW.XX.YY.ZZZ, where each set of digits refers to the Environment, Ecological End-product, Direct Use/Non-use, and Direct User classes and subclasses, a useful feature for aggregating items in natural capital accounting tables, representing a unique potential pathway through which changes in Natural Capital may affect human welfare. • Natural capital accounting efforts are directly relevant to the structured decision-making step ""Estimate Consequences"" in answering the question, ""What ecosystem services models or data are needed to estimate consequences?"" • Natural capital accounting helps EBM practitioners organize: information for a given decision context; ways to approach the identification and valuation of the final ecosystem services for EBM decision making, especially relevant for evaluating management options (e.g., scenarios); and the standardized tracking of specific final ecosystem services over time. Needs to Advance EBM • As a new potential tool in the EBM toolbox, EBM practitioners need to examine natural capital accounting principles as part of efforts to analyze different scenario options as part of a decision context. • Several natural capital accounting approaches (e.g., NESCS and InVEST) could be applied to the same decision context to inform the value-added benefits of natural capital accounting in EBM decisions.","2020-08","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2022-05-04 13:26:03","","149–163","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-45843-0_8","","","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Social Science; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Natural Resource Management; 2020; Year 6; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2016C14-003; K:ecosystem-based management; K:natural capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter reviews studies on SES, particularly focusing on the conceptual and analytical advances made by projects and publications from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme, to reveal often hidden patterns in trade-offs, power asymmetries, global and regional drivers, and historic and threshold effects, which were not previously obvious in the poverty contexts being studied. ESPA studies highlight the value of a wide diversity of interdisciplinary modelling approaches, teamed with concerted efforts to collect fit-for-purpose and long-term social, ecological and social-ecological data, as critical to the detection and avoidance of undesirable future trajectories and known or suspected thresholds. The Sustainable Development Goals, together with learning from the ESPA programme, provide a fertile ground to recognise and govern the complex social-ecological dynamics and feedbacks, the cross-scale drivers of trade and financial flows, the power asymmetries at work in the world, and the rapidly approaching tipping points in the climate and earth system.","2018-04","2021-11-17 16:12:14","2021-12-01 12:54:15","","","","","","","","Social-ecological systems approaches","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 16","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YTS5SD5D/Reyers and Selomane - 2018 - Social-ecological systems approaches Revealing an.pdf","","2018; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; Year 1; T:Sustainability; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2012T3-004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In coastal agricultural areas, SWI is causing changes in biogeochemical cycling in soil and waterways. These changes are leading to the release of excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from farm fields, which in turn can cause impaired water quality downstream. I explored the effects of saltwater intrusion on N and P concentrations of surface water and soil porewater on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed on three spatial and temporal scales: 1) a three-year field study through farmland and various surrounding habitats; 2) a one-month laboratory soil incubation study; and 3) a regional study of tidal tributaries (sub-watersheds) along Maryland’s Eastern Shore where I utilized 35 years of observational data on nutrient concentrations and salinity from the Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program. The results of the field and incubation studies suggest that SWI can cause a large release of N and P from the soils of coastal landscapes to downstream water bodies such as tidal creeks and marshes. However, the results of the regional study suggest that the relative magnitude of SWI-driven contributions of N and P to waterways as compared to other sources and drivers of N and P differ depending on the spatial and temporal scale considered. Defining mechanisms through which SWI spurs nutrient release from soils of agricultural fields and surrounding habitats as well as the magnitude of these processes is critical for quantifying N and P export in coastal watersheds. The results of these three studies can potentially be used to inform water quality models for individual tidal tributaries, which would allow for more targeted approaches to nutrient load reductions in sub-watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay and other watersheds globally.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:30:01","2021-12-01 12:52:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Maryland, College Park","","","","PhD Dissertation","","","","","","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Climate Change; reported to NSF; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; F:Water & People; T:Pollution; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; T:Coasts & Shorelines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of sustainability, however, is most often implicitly associated with human economic activities or complex systems of human economic activities that are constrained by environmental limits. From the perspective of current environmental concerns, the essentially economic concepts of sustainable yield and sustainable development are flawed. The former is strongly anthropocentric and has historically ignored ecological (and mathematical) complexity. The latter, while based on weak anthropocentrism, is also based on weak sustainability—artificial capital may be substituted for depleted natural capital; and thus the only things the present generation need bequeath to future generations are wealth and an entrepreneurial culture. Norton rejects weak sustainability, but also strong sustainability—the view that artificial capital cannot substitute for natural capital—championed by ecological economists and conservation biologists. Strong sustainability, according to Norton, is about “stuff,” while sustainable societies commit themselves to “to perpetuate place-based values and project them into the future.” Place-based values, however, are not always environmentally sound—think, for example, of coal-country values or desert-casino-country values. Alternatively, ecological sustainability conceives the human economy to be (as in fact it is) a subset of the economy of nature. The economy of nature is powered by solar energy and efficiently re-cycles materials. A sustainable human economy would thus pattern itself as microcosm to macrocosm on the economy of nature, lest growth of the former seriously disrupt the latter.","2016-10","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2021-12-01 12:41:25","","27–47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-92597-4_3","","","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Fellow; T:Humanities; K:ecological sustainability; K:economy of nature; K:strong sustainability; K:sustainable development; K:sustainable yield; K:weak sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim is to increase understanding of the impacts different forcing schemes have on water quality model simulation. Simulations were completed using three forcing approaches: 1) using ""traditional"" USGS-derived input from 10 major rivers; 2) using ""concentrated"" input from 10 major rivers derived from watershed model output; and 3) using ""diffuse"" input from 1117 rivers derived from watershed model output. Comparisons of these schemes revealed large impacts on simulations in Chesapeake Bay during periods of high flow and extreme weather events under diffuse forcing.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2021-12-01 12:36:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Maryland, College Park","","","","Master's Thesis","","","","","DOI: 10.13016/ijmx-z5ya","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8E7NIA35/Butler and Link to external site - Assessing the Impacts of Non-point Source Freshwat.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; 2019; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Modeling; Year 6; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:environmental science; 2016C14-019; K:Chesapeake Bay; K:estuary; K:numerical modeling; K:water quality; K:watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on the water-agriculture-environment nexus in the Murrumbidgee River Basin, Australia, and attempts to explain how reduced water allocation to agriculture aimed at protecting the environment in turn impacted the wider economy and the community. Predictably reduced water allocation saw declines in agriculture production and employment. Despite this, paradoxically, the basin unemployment rate declined and basin median household income increased. To understand and interpret this, we first analyze available labour, economic and hydrology data, and then develop a simple dynamic model to interpret the observed pattern of basin employment and unemployment. Data analysis revealed the likely causes behind the paradox as (a) out-migration of people from the basin, and (b) absorption of the labour force in the fast growing non-agricultural sectors of the diversified basin economy. The model simulations reinforced this interpretation. Further model simulations under alternative realities of out-migration and sectoral transformation indicated that basins embedded in faster growing national economies, and are more diversified to begin with, are likely to be more conducive to agriculture sector reform (e.g., reduced water allocation) and environmental regeneration. This is a sobering message for other regions experiencing environmental degradation due to extensive agricultural development.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2021-12-01 12:36:42","","178–188","","","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Economics; Year 2; T:Agriculture; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Modeling; 2013T5-001; F:Water & People; T:Engineering & Design; K:agricultural workers; K:agricultural workforce; K:Australia; K:water-agriculture-environment nexus; K:water-energy-food nexus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing studies address multiple water uses, such as agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation, as well as different societal benefits from aquatic species such as commercial and recreational fishing and endangered species preservation. The studies employ a variety of methodologies including stated and revealed preference, bioeconomic modeling, and reduced-form econometrics.

These defining characteristics, while bringing stability and predictability, pose challenges when it comes to managing dynamic natural systems. As our understanding of ecosystems improves, we must devise ways to account for the nonlinearities and uncertainties rife in complex social-ecological systems. This paper takes an in-depth look at the Platte River basin over time to explore how the system's resilience–the capacity to absorb disturbance without losing defining structures and functions–responds to human driven change. Beginning with pre-European settlement, the paper explores how water laws, policies, and infrastructure influenced the region's ecology and society. While much of the post-European development in the Platte River basin came at a high ecological cost to the system, the recent tri-state and federal collaborative Platte River Recovery and Implementation Program is a first step towards flexible and adaptive management of the social-ecological system. Using the Platte River basin as an example, we make the case that inherent flexibility and adaptability are vital for the next iteration of natural resources management policies affecting stressed basins. We argue that this can be accomplished by nesting policy in a resilience framework, which we describe and attempt to operationalize for use across systems and at different levels of jurisdiction. As our current natural resources policies fail under the weight of looming global change, unprecedented demand for natural resources, and shifting land use, the need for a new generation of adaptive, flexible natural resources governance emerges. Here we offer a prescription for just that, rooted in the social, ecological and political realities of the Platte River basin.","2014-04","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2021-11-30 22:27:52","","229","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 2; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014; T:Environmental History; 2013T5-006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, however, the communities of the Klamath Basin have worked together in an effort to transform the basin's governance in order to promote greater resilience across all these valences. This Article uses the four-phase adaptive cycle model that Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling described in 2002 to trace the history of the Klamath Basin social-ecological system (“SES”) through periods characterized by vulnerability, resilience, and transformation. We conclude that while Klamath Basin stakeholders have worked out a compromise settlement that may signify the emergence of a new, more resilient regime, the Basin's future is uncertain. We identify important thresholds that, if triggered, could move the SES into alternate regimes, and we consider whether formalization of emergent institutions through legislation might influence its trajectory.","2014-06","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2021-11-30 22:01:48","","157–193","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; K:adaptation; Year 2; T:Vulnerability; K:endangered species; 2014; T:Environmental History; 2013T5-006; K:adaptive governance; K:ESA; K:Klamath River; K:resilience; K:resilience assessment; K:SES; K:socio-ecological systems; K:stream adjudication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, we examine relationships between hydrologic regime and SOC stocks among wetlands. From wetland–upland, saturation was highly variable in the transition zone. Organo-mineral associations peaked in the transition zone while large macroaggregate SOC declined from wetland–upland. Across wetlands, indicators of drying (e.g., minimum water level and summertime recession rate) were more related to SOC than inundation duration. From wetland basin–upland, SOC stocks were significantly related to both mean water level and relative elevation. We highlight relationships between SOC and the dynamic hydrology of wetlands, emphasizing the need for research on how changing hydrologic regime may influence mineral wetland SOC.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:30:01","2021-11-30 21:25:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Maryland, College Park","College Park","","","masters thesis","","","","","DOI: 10.13016/VRG4-5P3Z","","","","Staff; no acknowledgment; 2019; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:Soil organic matter; K:carbon; K:soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A warmer atmosphere will hold more water and will result in more frequent and more intense El Niño events. Domestic and international water rights regimes must adapt to the more extreme drought and flood cycles resulting from these phenomena. Laws that allocate rights to water, both at the domestic level between water users and at the international level between nations sharing transboundary water sources, are frequently rigid governance systems ill-suited to adapt to a changing climate. Often, water laws allocate a fixed quantity of water for a certain type of use. At the domestic level, such rights may be considered legally protected private property rights or guaranteed human rights. At the international level, such water allocation regimes may also be dictated by human rights, as well as concerns for national sovereignty. These legal considerations may ossify water governance and inhibit water managers’ abilities to alter water allocations in response to changing water supplies. To respond to water variability arising from climate change, such laws must be reformed or reinterpreted to enhance their adaptive capacity. Such adaptation should consider both intra-generational equity and inter-generational equity. One potential approach to reinterpreting such water rights regimes is a stronger emphasis on the public trust doctrine. In many nations, water is a public trust resource, owned by the state and held in trust for the benefit of all citizens. Rights to water under this doctrine are merely usufructuary—a right to make a limited use of a specified quantity of water subject to governmental approval. The recognition and enforcement of the fiduciary obligation of water governance institutions to equitably manage the resource, and characterization of water rights as usufructuary, could introduce needed adaptive capacity into domestic water allocation laws. The public trust doctrine has been influential even at the international level, and that influence could be enhanced by recognizing a comparable fiduciary obligation for inter-jurisdictional institutions governing international transboundary waters. Legal reforms to facilitate water markets may also introduce greater adaptive capacity into otherwise rigid water allocation regimes. Water markets are frequently inefficient for several reasons, including lack of clarity in water rights, externalities inherent in a resource that ignores political boundaries, high transaction costs arising from differing economic and cultural valuations of water, and limited competition when water utilities are frequently natural monopolies. Legal reforms that clarify property rights in water, specify the minimum quantity, quality, and affordability of water to meet basic human needs and environmental flows, and mandate participatory and transparent water pricing and contracting could allow greater flexibility in water allocations through more efficient and equitable water markets.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2021-11-30 21:21:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199389414.013.643","","","","no acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; 2019; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Workshop; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; K:climate change; K:adaptive governance; K:water rights; 2017W-070; K:international law; K:water markets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its international reputation arose in part because of the writings of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who wove together a rich, natural, social, and cultural depiction of the area entitled River of Grass.  The ecosystem is characterized as a subtropical wetland, rich in biodiversity and other environmental values.  Such values are reflected in the portions of the Everglades set aside for conservation and preservation.  The areas of the Everglades with the deepest organic soils now support agricultural production of sugar and vegetables that rely on federal economic support.  A mild subtropical climate also contributes to a tourist economy, and abundant rainfall provides water resources for millions of inhabitants.  Such complexities illustrate a few of the interactions between people and their environment that can be distilled into a conceptual framework of the social-ecological system of the Everglades. ... Changing climate will pose important questions for those who manage the water infrastructure in southern Florida. One such question is will the climate become wetter, drier, or both? How will changes in tropical cyclones influence the manifestation of those changes at regional scales? What is the capacity of the social system to adapt, evolve, or devolve? How can conservation lands adapt to rising sea levels and the resultant ecological shifts? We attempt to respond to these questions in four subsequent sections. We begin with a recap (Part II) of the historic pattern of development in the Everglades SES during the twentieth century, indicating the ebb and flow of resilience, and shifts in social values and environmental crises. Part III assesses the resilience of the current water resource system (ecological and human components) to future climate change. Part IV evaluates the adaptive capacity (the ability of the system to manage regime shifts) of the current governance (including legal constraints) to anticipated climate shifts. We conclude in Part V with a summary of how the SES seems to be in a hierarchy or rigidity trap, and a discussion of obstacles to and opportunities for adaptation to impending climate change.","2014-04","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2021-11-30 21:13:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; Year 2; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:water governance; 2014; 2013T5-006; K:adaptive capacity; K:Everglades; K:rigidity trap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In all cases, we evaluate and identify changes using the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Aridity Index (AI) that measures the annual ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation. Annual fields of land surface precipitation and air temperature data are extracted from 1960 to 2017. We also compare aridity index summary statistics and trends between communal and non-communal land property regimes in Mexico as a proxy of communal environmental governance. Our results show that: (1) with some exceptions, most Latin American countries have experienced aridification from the 1961–1990 period to the 1991–2017 period, and the trend is for this pattern to continue; (2) in Mexico, communal lands experience slightly lower levels of aridification than non-communal lands. However, because the difference in aridity index values between periods is very small, the degree to which that difference is significant needs further research. If this difference were significant, it mean that communal land holders are at lower risk than non-communal land holders. At this point, however, we cannot claim that land regime practices have or have had any connection with the process of aridification itself.","2019-10","2020-11-17 20:30:07","2021-11-30 21:10:37","","281–299","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-22464-6_16","","","","Staff; T:Landscapes at Risk; no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; 2019; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:aridification; K:communal and non-communal lands; K:environmental governance; K:geospatial analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

THE CHALLENGES OF ENCOURAGING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT There is now abundant environmental law literature that calls for greater flexibility in the legal system to allow for adaptive management.1 Climate change is one motivator for these calls, though not the only one. But up until this point in time, many of the calls for greater flexibility have been fairly general. However, as good lawyers and legal scholars know, the devil in law is always in the details.2 Crafting specific statutory language (or principles courts can apply in judicial decision making) is essential to the success of any legal reform effort.3 Effective crafting of specific statutory language can make all the difference between success, and failure. Failure can be worse than failure to achieve the proposed reform goals; flawed reform efforts can make outcomes worse than they were before. I am therefore grateful for the recent efforts by Craig and Ruhl to propose specific statutory language to make environmental and natural resources law (and administrative law broadly) more friendly to adaptive  management.4 Indeed, Craig and Ruhl have even done us the favor of providing a sample model statute. They have begun a conversation that is important and necessary. My goal here is to provide a thoughtful, substantive response to their initial efforts—a critical but constructive engagement, similar to what might occur in the session of a legislative committee doing a mark-up of a bill.","2014","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2021-11-30 19:31:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; Year 2; T:Policy & Regulation; K:environmental law; 2014; 2013T5-006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The establishment of green infrastructure, including a stable urban forest, is a strategy to improve resilience not only to these events, but also to contribute to other environmental, social, and economic goals. To this end, cities throughout Los Angeles County have tree planting programs and policies aimed to grow and maintain their urban forests. Despite the policy objectives and management goals of such programs, we know surprisingly little about the spatial distribution of the existing urban forest, how and where the canopy has changed over time, or the composition of the population living in places of canopy change. To examine these questions, we conducted an analysis of the Los Angeles Coast based on land cover data derived from high-resolution aerial imagery and LiDAR. In addition to characterizing the overall percentages of existing and possible tree canopy in 2014, we also characterized the change in tree canopy from 2009 to 2014 with five measures of tree canopy and change: total canopy, persistence, loss, gain, and net change. We used market segmentation data to analyze the relationship between tree canopy and the composition of communities. Results indicated that tree canopy covered about 15% of coastal Los Angeles, but this cover was unevenly distributed throughout the study area. The parcel-level analysis of change indicated that while the canopy did not change much from 2009-2014, the changes that did occur were localized and would have been missed at a coarser scale of analysis.

Williams","Species Recovery in the United States: Increasing the Effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act","","","","","https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/50145","The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has succeeded in shielding hundreds of species from extinction and improving species recovery over time. However, recovery for most species officially protected by the ESA—i.e., listed species—has been harder to achieve than initially envisioned. Threats to species are persistent and pervasive, funding has been insufficient, the distribution of money among listed species is highly uneven, and at least 10 times more species than are actually listed probably qualify for listing. Moreover, many listed species will require ongoing management for the foreseeable future to protect them from persistent threats. Climate change will exacerbate this problem and increase both species risk and management uncertainty, requiring more intensive and controversial management strategies to prevent species from going extinct. In this Issue, we provide an overview of the ESA, summarize the causes and patterns of species endangerment in the United States, identify key successes and shortcomings of recovery programs, and discuss the following six broad strategies to increase the effectiveness of ESA implementation: 1. Establish and consistently apply a system for prioritizing recovery funding to maximize strategic outcomes for listed species. 2. Strengthen partnerships for species recovery by expanding collaboration among federal agencies, the states, and nongovernmental organizations and by developing incentives for private landowners. 3. Promote more monitoring and adaptive management for species recovery. Conduct targeted, efficient monitoring programs to assess species status and improve management strategies, and use adaptive management to deal with ecological complexity and uncertainty. 4. Refine methods to develop more objective, measurable recovery criteria based on the best available science. 5. Use well-established climate-smart conservation strategies such as increasing habitat connectivity and reducing nonclimate stressors; evaluate and consider using innovative climate adaptation strategies, including protecting potential future habitats, assisted colonization, and engineering new habitats. 6. Evaluate ecosystem-based approaches such as surrogate species and coarse ecological filters to develop methods that increase the efficiency of managing for recovery.","2016-01","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2021-11-30 17:57:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publication Title: The Ecological Society of America Volume: 20","","","","T:Resilience; no acknowledgment; Year 2; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; F:Actionable Research; 2016; T:Policy & Regulation; 2012PF-003; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:climate change; K:Endangered Species Act (ESA); K:extinction; K:management strategies; K:species recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investigations into the impact of neighbouring crowding on tree performance have generally been conducted at local scales, missing important regional-scale context such as the suitability of the climate for each species. Favourable climates may enhance tree performance, but this may come at the cost of increased neighbourhood crowding and competition negatively impacting survival and growth. Through the synthesis of continental-scale forest inventory and trait datasets from the northeast USA and Puerto Rico we present an analytical approach that elucidates the important interactions between local competitive and regional climatic contexts. Our results show strong asymmetries in competitive interactions and significant niche differences that are dependent on habitat suitability. The strong interaction between local neighbourhood and regional climate highlights the need for models that consider the interaction between these two processes that have been previously ignored.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2021-11-30 15:07:41","","","","1855","284","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7GFHLKJS/Zambrano et al. - 2017 - Local neighbourhood and regional climatic contexts.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2017; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Ecology; 2015PF-017; K:tree demography; K:forest ecology; K:functional trait; K:future scenario; K:plant community ecology; K:species distribution; K:temperate forest; K:tropical forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, evaluating the plausibility of different SRM scenarios remains difficult and more collaboration between natural and social scientists is required. Moreover, the environmental and social impacts remain essentially unknown. We review evidence on impacts across stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening technologies and scenarios. Rapid SRM termination, resulting in rapid climate change, would significantly increase threats to global biodiversity and ecosystems from climate change, especially in the tropics. In contrast, more measured use of SRM could reduce some climate risks for biodiversity but further research is needed. Agricultural impacts from geoengineering are predicted to be complicated. In general, cooling from SRM would benefit most crops but precipitation reductions could have negative impacts on rice and groundnuts in Asia.

Studies of the biodiversity of Neotropical macro-organisms have recognized the roles of environmental, spatial, and historical factors in structuring communities at different spatial and temporal scales, but the influences on microorganisms are not well studied. Diatoms (unicellular siliceous algae) are a very species-rich group of algae, disperse widely, and respond rapidly and sensitively to environmental variation. In this chapter, we use a newly constructed database of tropical South American diatoms (8°N–30°S and 58–79°W) to analyze the distribution and diversity patterns of species across lentic and lotic environments, including predictors that describe local (limnology) and regional (geo-climatic) factors. We provide a conceptual framework that examines community responses (species composition and diversity) to environmental and spatial factors by applying paleolimnology and macroecological approaches (Theory of Island of Biogeography and metacommunity theory). Diatom biogeographic patterns emerge for (1) identifying regionally distinct floras with a significant association with geographic groups of lakes, (2) determining latitudinal gradients of species richness and community structure, and (3) estimating the joint contribution of environmental filtering and dispersal dynamics in affecting diatom community composition across time. We emphasize the potential for incorporating diatom ecology and paleolimnology into a macroecology framework to further develop multiple, interdisciplinary hypotheses on the mechanisms driving microbial diversity and community assembly in the Neotropics.","2020","2020-11-17 20:30:03","2021-11-29 21:48:11","","121–143","","","","","","","","","","","Springer, Cham","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-31167-4_7","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/88FQDKRG/Benito and Fritz - 2020 - Diatom Diversity and Biogeography Across Tropical .pdf","","Staff; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; T:Ecology; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; K:amazon; K:andes; K:diatoms; K:lakes; K:latitudinal diversity; K:metacommunities; K:microbial biogeography","","Valentí Rull; Ana Carolina Carnaval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The social implications of rising sea levels induced by climate change can also be explored with an optional jigsaw activity. Students who successfully complete this case study will integrate key concepts related to sea level rise, interpret scientific data and draw conclusions about environmental change, and evaluate alternative management decisions.

Among benthic microorganisms (10 μm–500 mm), diatoms and foraminifera are of great importance in aquatic ecosystems worldwide because (1) their species react in a rapid and sensitive way to environmental changes in water bodies, and (2) they preserve in sediments for a long time due to their shells, which are made of silica (diatoms) or calcium carbonate or cemented detrital material (foraminifera). In shallow coastal ecosystems (coastal lagoons, marshes), these attributes make foraminifera and diatoms extremely valuable for both ecology and geology because modern communities indicate the dynamic transition between terrestrial and marine habitats, and fossil assemblages record past sea-level changes. While many other works provide specific information on the taxonomy, biology, and ecology of foraminifera and diatoms independently, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive joint perspective of the applications and uses of these two groups of organisms for environmental studies in coastal habitats. Given the ongoing and future threats associated with sea-level rise and water scarcity, and the lack of long-term monitoring data to assess ecosystems' deviation from natural baseline conditions, palaeoecological applications of foraminifera and diatoms are also discussed in the context of environmental and restoration policies.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:30:02","2021-11-29 19:24:30","","257–280","","","","","","","","","","","Springer, Cham","Cham","","","","","","","","Section: 15 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-39212-3_15","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5CUBGINF/Benito - 2020 - Benthic Foraminifera and Diatoms as Ecological Ind.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 8; 2018PF-044; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Coasts & Shorelines; T:Environmental History; K:benthic microorganisms; K:coastal ecosystems; K:coastal habitats; K:marine habitats","","Gabriel Cristóbal; Saúl Blanco; Gloria Bueno","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Richerson","Applying cultural evolution to sustainability challenges: an introduction to the special issue","Sustainability Science","","","","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11625-017-0516-3","Human activity at multiple scales is the primary driver of the environmental challenges humanity faces (Steffen et al. 2007). Numerous scholars have argued that addressing environmental problems will require large-scale change in human behavior and the institutional, social and cultural forces that shape behavior (Princen 2003; Speth 2008; Beddoe et al. 2009; Assadourian 2010; Kinzig et al. 2013). In fact, most definitions of sustainability and sustainable development implicitly or explicitly recognize the need for changes in human perspectives, aspirations, technologies, norms, or worldviews—in short, cultureFootnote1. However, calls for cultural change often stop short of proposing the precise mechanisms through which such change may occur precisely because the relevant mechanisms of behavioral and cultural change are not known. The multiple disciplines that comprise the social sciences and humanities have different and, often competing, theories of cultural change that operate at multiple levels of human organization. These disciplinary differences have been a challenge for sustainability science (Gardner 2013), and the absence of a robust, non-disciplinary, theoretical framework hinders progress towards a deeper understanding of when and how sustainable social-ecological systems emerge (Levin and Clark 2010). Recently, sustainability scientists have been explicit about the need to incorporate mechanisms of cultural change in their research (Beddoe et al. 2009; Caldas et al. 2015) and to clarify the exact mechanisms involved (Ehrlich and Levin 2005; Waring et al. 2015). Importantly, cultural evolution theory offers an integrative approach to studying the dynamics of cultural change based on causal models of the mechanisms through which individual and population processes interact. Despite many examples of sustainable resource management, exploitative and unsustainable resource management are common (Steffen et al. 2007). However, cultural change may be important for driving the proliferation of sustainable practices. This is because, although evolved genetic mechanisms, ecological processes, and socio-cultural mechanisms all influence resource use, social conditions often change more quickly than ecological conditions and cultural evolution is more rapid than genetic evolution (Perreault 2012). As such, there is an urgent need for sustainability scientists to develop more holistic or inclusive models to explain and integrate socio-cultural mechanisms of change at both individual and institutional levels (Borgerhoff Mulder and Coppolillo 2005). Such models are needed to inform sustainability policy solutions that can be applied cross-culturally and in divergent contexts. Currently, however, the dynamics of cultural change are not well understood in the context of sustainability. By focusing on applications of cultural evolution, we view this special issue as a starting point for determining how we can harness processes of cultural change (Wilson et al. 2014) to build more sustainable communities and societies.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2021-11-29 19:00:34","","1–8","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Japan","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Social Science; T:Sustainability; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Venture; Year 3; T:Humanities; 2014V-028; K:cultural change; K:cultural evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of studies have presented the notion of the ‘echo chamber’ to model and explain information flows across an array of social settings, finding disproportionate connections among ideologically similar political communicators. This paper builds on these findings to provide a more formal operationalization of the components of echo chambers. We then empirically test their utility using survey data collected from the community of political elites engaged in the contentious issue of climate politics in the United States. Our survey period coincides with the most active and contentious period in the history of US climate policy, when legislation regulating carbon dioxide emissions had passed through the House of Representatives and was being considered in the Senate. We use exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to demonstrate that both the homogeneity of information (the echo) and multi-path information transmission (the chamber) play significant roles in policy communication. We demonstrate that the intersection of these components creates echo chambers in the climate policy network. These results lead to some important conclusions about climate politics, as well as the relationship between science communication and policymaking at the elite level more generally.","2015-05","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2021-11-29 18:56:20","","782–786","","8","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RP4525BW/nclimate2666.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/35PI9YIU/Jasny et al. - 2015 - An empirical examination of echo chambers in US cl.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2015; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; T:Modeling; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2013PF-007; T:Political Science; K:climate change policy; K:communication; K:policy communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case studies of North American water basins reveal that the massive engineering of these systems have facilitated economic and social development to meet objectives of navigation, irrigation, flood control, hydropower, safe drinking water, recreation and pollution abatement. To meet these goals, the governance and management of these systems successfully stabilized key hydrologic and ecosystem processes, which in turn led to a decline in ecological resilience and adaptive capacity. While efforts to recover lost ecosystem functions within managed river systems are underway, the capacity to adapt to these restoration efforts and the system in general to ongoing climate change, is hindered by physical infrastructure, legal fragmentation and governmental inflexibility. Response to accelerating change and the inadequacy of fragmented legal regimes is apparent in emergence of self-organized governance at the problem or basin-regional scale. Such self-organization is categorized as adaptive governance or in this application, adaptive water governance. Self-organization alone will not allow adaptation to keep pace with accelerating global change and climate uncertainty. Adaptive water governance requires government facilitation to build adaptive capacity in time to respond to change and ensure that greater involvement of private actors and increased flexibility do not come at the expense of legitimacy, transparency, accountability, equity and justice.","2020-09","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2021-11-29 16:26:28","","171–192","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-48110-0_8","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7IUCRRB3/Cosens and Gunderson - 2021 - Adaptive Governance in North American Water System.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; Year 2; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; Workshop; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Engineering & Design; 2013T5-006; K:adaptive governance; K:adaptive capacity; K:adaptive water governance; K:ecosystem services/functions; K:socio-environmental systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the relevant theory and current empirical evidence for additive, synergistic, and antagonistic interactions between hydrologic alteration and species invasions in flowing waters. Building on case studies of both animal and plant communities, we demonstrate the importance of the alteration-invasion nexus to mediate biotic interactions and alter food web structure via top-down and bottom-up effects.

It is a relatively new topic of study but has grown enormously in recent years. Because of its interdisciplinary nature the very concept of biodiversity is the subject of debate amongst philosophers, biologists, geographers and environmentalists. The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Biodiversity is an outstanding reference source to the key topics and debates in this exciting subject. Comprising twenty-three chapters by a team of international contributors the Handbook is divided into six parts: Historical and sociological contexts, focusing on the emergence of the term and early attempts to measure biodiversity What is biodiversity? How should biodiversity be defined? How can biodiversity include entities at the edge of its boundaries, including microbial diversity and genetically engineered organisms? Why protect biodiversity? What can traditional environmental ethics contribute to biodiversity? Topics covered include anthropocentrism, intrinsic value, and ethical controversies surrounding the economics of biodiversity Measurement and methodology: including decision-theory and conservation, the use of indicators for biodiversity, and the changing use of genetics in biodiversity conservation Social contexts and global justice: including conservation and community conflicts and biodiversity and cultural values Biodiversity and other environmental values: How does biodiversity relate to other values like ecological restoration or ecological sustainability? Essential reading for students and researchers in philosophy, environmental science and environmental studies, and conservation management, it will also be extremely useful to those studying biodiversity in subjects such as biology and geography.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2021-11-26 20:15:02","","","349","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017; no acknowledgment; F:Biodiversity; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Year 3; Fellow; T:Environmental History; T:Humanities; 2014F-008","","Justin Garson; Anya Plutynski; Sahotra Sarkar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Cambodia, there has been a surge in economic land concessions, in which long-term leases are provided to foreign and domestic investors for economic development. More than two million hectares have been leased so far, sparking debate over the consequences for local communities and the environment. Here we combined official records of concession locations with a high-resolution data set of changes in forest cover to quantify the contribution of land concessions to deforestation between 2000 and 2012. We used covariate matching to control for variables other than classification as a concession that may influence forest loss. Nearly half of the area where concessions were granted between 2000 and 2012 was forested in 2000; this area then represented 12.4% of forest land cover in Cambodia. Within concessions, the annual rate of forest loss was between 29% and 105% higher than in comparable land areas outside concessions. Most of the deforestation within concessions occurred after the contract date, and whether an investor was domestic or foreign had no effect on deforestation rates. We conclude that land acquisitions can act as powerful drivers of deforestation.","2015-09","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:39:47","","772–775","","10","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","143 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Research","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GSZIFVPT/Davis et al. - 2015 - Accelerated deforestation driven by large-scale la.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YSCWTR9T/ngeo2540.html","","T:Landscapes at Risk; no acknowledgment; T:Economics; 2015; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Venture; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; K:deforestation; K:forest cover change; 2014V-029; T:Disturbance; K:concessions; K:land acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agriculture, in turn, is globalized through the trade of agricultural commodities. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that emphasizes four tradeoffs involving water-use decision-making that are important yet not always considered in a consistent framework. One tradeoff focuses on competition for water among different economic sectors. A second tradeoff examines the possibility that certain types of agricultural investments can offset water use. A third tradeoff explores the possibility that the rest of the world can be a source of supply or demand for a country's water-using commodities. The fourth tradeoff concerns how variability in water supplies influences farmer decision-making. We show conditions under which trade liberalization affect water use. Two policy scenarios to reduce water use are evaluated. First, we derive a target tax that reduces water use without offsetting the gains from trade liberalization, although important tradeoffs exist between economic performance and resource use. Second, we show how subsidization of water-saving technologies can allow producers to use less water without reducing agricultural production, making such subsidization an indirect means of influencing water use decision-making. Finally, we outline conditions under which riskiness of water availability affects water use. These theoretical model results generate hypotheses that can be tested empirically in future work.","2016-03","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2023-12-07 17:39:47","","32–41","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XMQE7G2Q/Dang et al. - 2016 - A theoretical model of water and trade.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; Year 2; T:Agriculture; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2013T5-001; 2016; F:Water & People; k:water resources; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:trade; F:Research Frameworks; K:trade-offs; K:decision making; K:decision-making under risk; K:profit maximization; K:theoretical model; K:water resources management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, invasive species may move faster than humans can diagnose problems and initiate solutions, and climate systems may exhibit long-term inertia and short-term fluctuations that obscure learning about the efficacy of management efforts in many ecological systems. We adopted a management-decision framework that distinguishes decision makers within public institutions from individual actors within the social system, calls attention to the ways socioecological systems respond to decision makers’ actions, and notes institutional learning that accrues from observing these responses. We used this framework, along with insights from bedeviling conservation problems, to create a typology that identifies problematic time-scale mismatches occurring between individual decision makers in public institutions and between individual actors in the social or ecological system. We also considered solutions that involve modifying human perception and behavior at the individual level as a means of resolving these problematic mismatches. The potential solutions are derived from the behavioral economics and psychology literature on temporal challenges in decision making, such as the human tendency to discount future outcomes at irrationally high rates. These solutions range from framing environmental decisions to enhance the salience of long-term consequences, to using structured decision processes that make time scales of actions and consequences more explicit, to structural solutions aimed at altering the consequences of short-sighted behavior to make it less appealing. Additional application of these tools and long-term evaluation measures that assess not just behavioral changes but also associated changes in ecological systems are needed.","2015-09","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:39:47","","42–49","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LXW5G3HK/Wilson et al. - 2016 - A typology of time-scale mismatches and behavioral.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W3HE33SK/cobi.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Economics; 2015; Foundation; T:Psychology; Year 2; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Research Frameworks; K:decision making; 2012F-004; K:decision theory; K:interventions; K:socioecological systems; K:temporal lags","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study describes a prey flux across the land–water interface associated with a behavioral response to multiple predators. Specifically, mangrove tree crabs (Aratus pisonii, hereafter Aratus) are primarily arboreal, but may jump off mangrove trees to escape avian predators, making them vulnerable to fish predation. Mesocosm experiments, field observations, and tethering assays were used to investigate behavioral responses, habitat shifts, and risk for Aratus associated with these two predator types. In the field, Aratus spent most of their time above the water on mangroves, where risk is lowest. In response to simulated bird strikes in mesocosm trials, crabs jumped off trees to escape imminent risk, and spent more time in and near the water, enhancing risk of fish predation. Fish attacks on crabs were nearly three times greater in treatments with simulated bird attacks. In addition, empirical diet data was used to examine the importance of Aratus as a prey item for a fish predator. Aratus represented up to 29% of diet by volume for one of the most common mesopredators in the Caribbean (gray snapper Lutjanus griseus), with the proportion varying greatly across space. Because Aratus consume mangrove-derived carbon, their consumption by aquatic predators represents another pathway by which mangrove production may be incorporated into aquatic food webs. These data suggest how the nexus of behavioral and food web ecology may provide for new perspectives on energy flow between ecosystems.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:39:47","","73–79","","","475","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XY5JWH6X/Yeager et al. - 2016 - A terrestrial-aquatic food web subsidy is potentia.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; K:behavior; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2016; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Disturbance; K:carbon; 2014PF-015; K:carbon flow; K:food web ecology; K:food webs; K:mangroves; K:spatial subsidies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, contemporary models do not adequately represent the role of spatially distributed wetlands in watershed-scale water storage and flows. Such tools are critical to better understand wetland hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological functions and predict management and policy outcomes at varying spatial scales. To develop a new approach for simulating depressional landscapes, we modified the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to incorporate improved representations of depressional wetland structure and hydrological processes. Specifically, we refined the model to incorporate: (1) water storage capacity and surface flowpaths of individual wetlands and (2) local wetland surface and subsurface exchange. We utilized this model, termed SWAT-DSF (DSF for Depressional Storage and Flows), to simulate the ∼289 km2 Greensboro watershed within the Delmarva Peninsula of the US Coastal Plain. Model calibration and verification used both daily streamflow observations and remotely sensed surface water extent data (ca. 2-week temporal resolution), allowing us to assess model performance with respect to both streamflow and watershed inundation patterns. Our findings demonstrate that SWAT-DSF can successfully replicate distributed wetland processes and resultant watershed-scale hydrology. SWAT-DSF provides improved temporal and spatial characterization of watershed-scale water storage and flows in depressional landscapes, providing a new tool to quantify wetland functions at broad spatial scales.","2018-12","2020-11-17 20:35:05","2023-12-07 17:39:47","","100002","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9Y8ADVLS/Evenson et al. - 2018 - A watershed-scale model for depressional wetland-rich landscapes.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JKBP2TVH/Evenson et al. - 2018 - A watershed-scale model for depressional wetland-r.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Modeling; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017PF-034; K:remote sensing; K:agricultural ditches; K:Delmarva Peninsula; K:depressional wetlands; K:geographically isolated wetlands; K:inundation mapping; K:modelling; K:non-floodplain wetlands; K:surface water extent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focused on urban forest patches, a distinct and underexplored subset of the urban forest that spans land uses and ownerships, and requires silvicultural practices to address their unique biophysical characteristics and management regimes. Our goal was to elucidate multi-scalar urban forest patch governance arrangements as they translated to on-the-ground management in four urban areas (Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) within the eastern United States. A transdisciplinary knowledge co-production framework was used to guide identification of the prominent management challenge or dilemma motivating change to forest patch management in each location, and to describe the dynamic interplay of decision-making and governance processes across locations as they advanced toward desired forest conditions. A common management goal existed across all four locations: multi-age, structurally complex forests dominated by regionally native species. Ecological and social concerns affected by local context and city capacity served as starting points prompting management action and new collaborations. Disparate governance arrangements including top-down municipal resources, regional conservation facilitated by landowners, and grass-roots community-driven stewardship led to diverse support-building processes and innovative strategies that served as forces initiating and shaping new management actions. Science and iterative learning and adaptation influenced change in all locations, reinforcing new management arrangements and practices. Among the four study areas, the earliest management of urban forest patches started in the 1980 s, historically lacking embeddedness in urban forest management more broadly, and experiencing challenges with integration into existing governance infrastructure. Ultimately, new management and governance approaches to urban forest patches in all four study areas have evolved uniquely and organically, driven by place-based historical legacies and ongoing socio-ecological feedbacks. The generalization of findings for broader urban forest management guidelines, such as for trees and park, would lead to misguided outcomes.","2022-09","2022-08-09 13:41:00","2023-12-07 17:39:46","2022-08-09 13:41:00","127693","","","75","","Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5KNZVF5Z/S1618866722002369.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 7; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2022; 2017PF-031; K:adaptive governance; 2017C17-017; K:Forest patch; K:Forestry; K:urban ecosystems; K:Urban forest; K:Urban forest governance; K:Urban forest management; K:urban forest patch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vulnerability assessments have been recognized as one way we can better understand which geographic areas and segments of society are more susceptible to adverse impacts from different stressors or hazards. The aims of this paper are to evaluate the state of coastal vulnerability assessment mapping efforts and to identify opportunities for advancement and refinement that will lead to more cohesive, impactful, and policy-relevant coastal vulnerability studies. We conducted a systematic review of the literature that addresses physical and social vulnerability to coastal hazards and contains corresponding mapping products. The content was analyzed for the scale of analysis, location, disciplinary focus, conceptual framework, metrics used, methodological approach, data sources, mapping output, and policy relevance. Results showed that most Coastal Vulnerability Mapping Assessments (CVMAs) are conducted at the local level using a range of methodologies, often with limited inclusion of social considerations and limited discussion of policy relevance. Based on our analysis, we provide seven recommendations for the advancement of this field that would improve CVMAs' methodological rigor, policy relevance, and alignment with other vulnerability assessment paradigms.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:39:46","","2822","","7","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","57 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: MDPI AG","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FBPGED6N/Bukvic et al. - 2020 - A Systematic Review of Coastal Vulnerability Mappi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PNDBXIXW/2822.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; reported to NSF; Year 5; 2020; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; F:Research Frameworks; K:sea level rise; K:sea-level rise; T:Coasts & Shorelines; wrong DBI; 2015C12-032; K:coastal; K:coastal flooding; K:exposure; K:mapping; K:sensitivity; K:storm surge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the United States, 30% to 50% of food produced is lost or wasted. These losses occur throughout multiple stages of the food supply chain from production to consumption. Reducing FLW prevents the waste of land, water, energy, and other resources embedded in food and is therefore essential to improving the sustainability of food systems. Despite the increasing number of studies identifying FLW reduction as a societal imperative, we lack the information needed to assess fully the effectiveness of interventions along the supply chain. In this paper, we synthesize the available literature, data, and methods for estimating the volume of FLW and assessing the full environmental and economic effects of interventions to prevent or reduce FLW in the United States. We describe potential FLW interventions in detail, including policy changes, technological solutions, and changes in practices and behaviors at all stages of the food system from farms to consumers and approaches to conducting economic analyses of the effects of interventions. In summary, this paper comprehensively reviews available information on the causes and consequences of FLW in the United States and lays the groundwork for prioritizing FLW interventions to benefit the environment and stakeholders in the food system.","2019-10","2020-11-17 20:30:14","2023-12-07 17:39:46","","1240–1254","","","685","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","68 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BQ7FYVSG/Muth et al. - 2019 - A systems approach to assessing environmental and .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IIVUL3RM/Muth et al. - 2019 - A systems approach to assessing environmental and economic effects of food loss and waste interventions in the Unit.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/M3Q3AYUU/S0048969719328037.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Economics; Foundation; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 6; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; Year 6 (JG); 2017F-010; 2018PF-041; Year 8 (QR); K:environmental impacts; K:cost-benefit analysis; K:food loss; K:food loss and waste; K:food waste; K:Interventions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Visual artifacts, such as knowledge maps, functioning as boundary objects, are used in hydropolitical contexts to convey understandings and facilitate discussion across scales about challenges and opportunities from multiple perspectives. Such focal points for discussion are valuable in creating shared, socially negotiated priorities and integrating diverse and often disparate cultural perspectives that naturally exist in the context of international transboundary water resources. Visual boundary objects can also represent the collective mental models of the actor countries and transboundary institutions and encompass their perspectives on the complex hydro-social cycles within specific “problem-shed” regions of the shared resources. To investigate and synthesize these multiple concepts, we developed a novel method of eliciting mental models from visual boundary objects in social-ecological contexts by combining content analysis with theoretical frameworks for boundary objects and systems thinking. Using this method, we analyzed visual boundary objects represented in publicly available documents formally related to decision making in the Pilcomayo River Basin in South America. The Pilcomayo River Basin is a unique case for investigating decision making in international collaboration among represented states, given the unique social and biophysical challenges that have plagued the region for over a century. Using our framework, we were able to develop insight into the collective mental models of stakeholders, organizations, and decision-making institutions, related to priorities, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies among the various socioeconomic, cultural, political, and biophysical drivers for different regions and scales of the basin.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:34:42","2023-12-07 17:39:46","","9","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FTU7RVXV/art9.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 5; C:Case Study; 2019; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; F:Water & People; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; K:socio-ecological systems; K:case study; K:modelling; 2016GS-003; K:boundary objects; K:hydropolitics; K:mental models; K:systems thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate city-scale effects of management interventions on plant–pollinator community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator ‘hotspots': gardens due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator diversity and leverage on city-scale plant–pollinator community robustness. Household income was positively associated with pollinator abundance in gardens, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic factors.

The factors influencing these events remain poorly understood, partly because amphibian spring movements tend to radiate from breeding sites and the animals are often difficult to locate at other times of the year. In this study, we investigate whether these movement patterns can be reproduced by a parsimonious model where foraging steps follow a heavy-tailed, Lévy alpha-stable distribution and individuals may either return to a previous refuge site or establish a new one. We consider three versions of the return behaviour: (1) a distance-independent probability of return to any previous refuge; (2) constant probability of return to the nearest refuge; or (3) a distance-dependent probability of return to each refuge. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we fit each version of the model to radiotracking data from a population of Fowler's Toads, which inhabits a linear sand dune habitat on the north shore of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. Only the model with distance-independent, random returns provides a good fit of the inter-refuge distance distribution and the number of refuges visited per toad. Our results suggest that while toads occasionally forage over long distances, the establishment of new refuges is not driven by the minimization of energy expenditure.","2017-09","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:39:45","","63–69","","24","360","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JHSNDSUA/Marchand et al. - 2017 - A stochastic movement model reproduces patterns of.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2017; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; T:Modeling; K:amphibians; K:modeling; K:modelling; K:Bayesian; K:animal movement; K:approximate Bayesian computation; K:foraging; K:Lévy walk; K:radiotracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding and leveraging the range of knowledge types, motivations, skills, and goals of diverse participants and their networks is fundamental to sustainable and resilient cities. As efforts to examine and understand urban stewardship networks continue to emerge, it is increasingly clear that there are no structured or systematic frameworks to guide the integration of social and ecological phenomena. Such a framework could facilitate planning new urban stewardship network research, and provide a basis for comparisons among cities and their urban stewardship networks. In this paper, we develop and present a social-ecological framework for examining and understanding urban stewardship networks.

We propose an approach that conceptualizes rural landscapes as social–ecological systems embedded within intersecting multi-scalar processes. Based on such a framing, empirical research can be more clearly set in the context of system properties that may influence food security, biodiversity conservation, or both.

To date, research has focused on quantifying accumulation rates in individual or groups of aquatic ecosystems to quantify the aquatic carbon sinks. However, there hasn't been a synthesis of rates across aquatic ecosystem to address the variability in rates within and among ecosystems types. Doing so would identify gaps in our understanding of accumulation rates and potentially reveal carbon sinks vulnerable to change. We synthesized accumulation rates from the literature, compiling 464 rate measurements from 103 studies of carbon accumulated in the modern period (ca. 200 years). Accumulation rates from the literature spanned four orders of magnitude varying substantially within and among ecosystem categories, with mean estimates for ecosystem categories ranging from 15.6 to 73.2 g C m−2 y−1 within ecosystem categories. With the exception of lakes, mean accumulation rates were poorly constrained due to high variability and paucity of data. Despite the high uncertainty, the estimates of modern accumulation rate compiled here are an important step for constructing carbon budgets and predicting future change.","2018-10","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:39:45","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISBN: 4159801834126","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Y49RW3R5/Wilkinson et al. - 2018 - A synthesis of modern organic carbon accumulation .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/STPSD7VH/s41598-018-34126-y.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Synthesis Research; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; Year 6; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2016PF-029; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:aquatic ecosystem types; K:ecosystem categories; K:literature synthesis; K:mean accumulation rate; K:organic carbon accumulation rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the scale at which drug trafficking represents a driver of forest loss is not presently known. We estimated the degree to which narcotics trafficking may contribute to forest loss using an unsupervised spatial clustering of 15 spatial and temporal forest loss patch metrics developed from global forest change data. We distinguished anomalous forest loss from background loss patches for each country exhibiting potential 'narco-capitalized' signatures which showed a statistically significant dissimilarity from other patches in terms of size, timing, and rate of forest loss. We also compared annual anomalous forest loss with the number of cocaine shipments and volume of cocaine seized, lost, or delivered at country- and department-level. For Honduras, results from linear mixed effects models showed a highly significant relationship between anomalous forest loss and the timing of increased drug trafficking (F = 9.90, p = 0.009) that also differed significantly from temporal patterns of background forest loss (t-ratio = 2.98, p = 0.004). Other locations of high forest loss in Central America showed mixed results. The timing of increased trafficking was not significantly related to anomalous forest loss in Guatemala and Nicaragua, but significantly differed in patch size compared to background losses. We estimated that cocaine trafficking could account for between 15% and 30% of annual national forest loss in these three countries over the past decade, and 30% to 60% of loss occurred within nationally and internationally designated protected areas. Cocaine trafficking is likely to have severe and lasting consequences in terms of maintaining moist tropical forest cover in Central America. Addressing forest loss in these and other tropical locations will require a stronger linkage between national and international drug interdiction and conservation policies.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:39:45","","054015","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","","","2017; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2015C12-030; K:Narcotrafficking; K:land use change; K:Central America; K:cocaine trafficking; K:counter narcotics data; K:forest loss; K:narcotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there is substantial research on case studies of mangrove management, global comparisons of mangrove governance are lacking. This research aims to fill this gap by comparing relationships among qualities of governance across mangrove social-ecological systems worldwide. Through a systematic literature search and screening process, we identified 65 articles that discussed mangrove governance and conservation. Case studies in these articles, drawn from 39 countries, were categorized as top-down, bottom-up, or comanaged and thematically coded to assess the influence of eight principles of good governance in mangrove conservation success. Across all three governance systems, the principles of legitimacy, fairness, and integration were most important in determining conservation success or failure. These principles are closely related to the concept of procedural justice, highlighting the importance of stakeholder inclusion throughout all stages of mangrove management. Thus, we recommend clearly defined roles for all governance actors, transparent communication of policy development to stakeholders, fairness in both process and outcome, and careful consideration of sustainable access to conservation resources.","2021-10","2022-10-18 19:58:40","2023-12-07 17:39:44","2022-10-18 19:58:40","e13850","","1","36","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cobi.13850","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/893XFKC3/Golebie et al. - 2022 - A qualitative systematic review of governance prin.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZD7RWK8U/cobi.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; reported to NSF; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2021; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; K:social-ecological systems; K:co-management; K:comanagement; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:environmental policy; K:wetlands; K:mangroves; 2018GS6-006; K:community-based natural resource management (CBNRM); K:decentralized governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying indices that reliably measure the functional diversity dimension(s) of interest requires careful testing of how each index responds to species' traits and abundance distributions. In the absence of a convenient simulation tool, tests with artificial data have to date explored only a limited number of scenarios or have altered trait and abundance distributions only indirectly based on principles of evolution and community assembly. We provide simul.comms, an R function that allows users to test the efficacy of functional diversity indices by easily creating artificial species communities with user-specified abundance and trait distributions for continuous, ordinal and categorical traits. To illustrate the function's utility, we examine the performance of R, a recently published abundance-sensitive index for functional redundancy. We use two approaches to designing simulation tests for this example analysis. The first uses simul.comms to create six separate sets of artificial communities to qualitatively assess how R responds to predictable changes in functional redundancy. The second uses simul.comms to independently alter seven community composition parameters, whose influence on R is then examined quantitatively via effect sizes in linear regression. Our analyses indicate that R broadly mirrors expected changes in functional redundancy and predictably responds to changes in community composition parameters. R appears, however, to primarily reflect trait distributions, responding minimally to variance in abundance and counter-intuitively to abundance range. Further refinement of tools to measure functional redundancy may therefore be desirable. The R tool we provide should assist with refining functional diversity measures, a critical step towards improving our ability to understand and mitigate the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. Because simul.comms simply produces two linked matrices, a species-by-traits matrix and a site-by-species abundance matrix, it may be equally valuable in exploring questions and analytical approaches in other areas of community ecology.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:39:44","","200-206","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PYTFXZ3X/McPherson et al. - 2018 - A simulation tool to scrutinise the behaviour of f.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7L9JYLFI/2041-210X.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Ecology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2014PF-015; K:abundance distributions; K:artificial ecological communities; K:diversity metrics; K:functional diversity; K:functional redundancy; K:index reliability; K:R code; K:simulation tool; K:simulations; K:site-by-species abundance matrix; K:trait distributions; K:traits matrix","","Samantha Price","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Designed to conserve marine biodiversity, many MPAs also seek to foster sustainable development. As is the case for many other environmental policies and programs, the impacts of MPAs are poorly understood. Social–ecological systems, impact evaluation, and common-pool resource governance are three complementary scientific frameworks for documenting and explaining the ecological and social impacts of conservation interventions. We review key components of these three frameworks and their implications for the study of conservation policy, program, and project outcomes. Using MPAs as an illustrative example, we then draw upon these three frameworks to describe an integrated approach for rigorous empirical documentation and causal explanation of conservation impacts. This integrated three-framework approach for impact evaluation of governance in social–ecological systems (3FIGS) accounts for alternative explanations, builds upon and advances social theory, and provides novel policy insights in ways that no single approach affords. Despite the inherent complexity of social–ecological systems and the difficulty of causal inference, the 3FIGS approach can dramatically advance our understanding of, and the evidentiary basis for, effective MPAs and other conservation initiatives.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:39:44","","93–115","","1","1399","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XLUVMJKP/Mascia et al. - 2017 - A novel framework for analyzing conservation impac.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HBSYRLCN/nyas.html","","K:social–ecological systems; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; Pursuit; Year 1; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Research Frameworks; K:marine protected areas; K:biodiversity conservation; 2012T3-007; 2014PF-011; K:common pool resources; K:ecological integrity; K:human well-being; K:impact evaluation; K:MPAs; K:Protected areas; Year 4 (DG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By contrast, we show that 70–80% of human pathogens are environmentally transmitted (i.e., people are infected through contact with free-living stages or environmental reservoirs including soil, water, vectors, food, or non- human hosts in the environment). In fact, environmentally transmitted diseases represent about 40% of today's global burden of human infectious disease (or 150 million disability adjusted life-years). Here, we call for renewed attention to the connection between human health and environmental factors, with a focus on identifying ecological solutions to interrupt transmission. METHODS: We developed a simple modelling framework that is able to capture the two main transmission pathways—namely, direct (host-to-host transmission, such in the case of influenza and measles) and transmission through an environmental reservoir (such, in the case of cholera, vector borne diseases, helminthiasis and sapronosis). We used the epidemiological model to analyse the role of ecological drivers for environmentally transmitted parasites and pathogens and to investigate the effectiveness of drug treatment for both directly and environmentally transmitted diseases.  FINDINGS: Through the analysis of system dynamics, we show that periodic drug treatments that lead to the elimination of directly transmitted diseases might fail to do so in the case of human pathogens with an environmental reservoir. For environmentally transmitted diseases, more effective control can be achieved when classic treatment strategies are complemented with interventions that act on the environmental reservoir of the pathogen or reduce exposure.  INTERPRETATION: Control of environmentally transmitted diseases can be more effective when human treatment is complemented with interventions targeting the environmental reservoir of the pathogen. Wherever environmental approaches to reduce human disease and preserve ecosystems are available, health practitioners, environmental scientists, and communities can work synergistically to solve health problems.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:39:44","","","","","389","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; no acknowledgment; Year 2; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Venture; T:Modeling; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Research Frameworks; 2012V-009; K:Epidemiology; K:Environmnetally transmitted diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article draws on key insights from studies of the interdisciplinary process and proposes the “sharing meanings approach” for improving interdisciplinary collaboration in hazards research. The sharing meanings approach addresses common challenges to interdisciplinary teamwork and organizes them into four focal areas: (1) worldviews (including ontological, epistemological, and philosophical perspectives), (2) language, (3) research design, and (4) project goals. The approach emphasizes the process of sharing rather than seeking to develop a single set of shared meanings related to the four focal areas. The article identifies common challenges and recommends strategies and actions within each focal area for guiding teams toward sharing their implicit meanings. A hypothetical example is introduced to demonstrate how the approach offers a path for revealing and overcoming the common roadblocks experienced in interdisciplinary hazards research. By making interdisciplinary hazards teams' implicit assumptions explicit, the sharing meanings approach offers an operational process to seize on moments of difference as productive tension and to see such challenges as opportunities—rather than obstacles—for innovating toward hybrid methodological research designs in hazards research.","2018-10","2020-11-17 20:30:26","2023-12-07 17:39:44","","1162-1170","","7","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VVJGIRQU/Hardy - 2018 - A Sharing Meanings Approach for Interdisciplinary Hazards Research.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7GUI924D/Hardy - 2021 - A Sharing Meanings Approach for Interdisciplinary .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DJ9YY7U8/risa.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; T:Team Science & Collaborations; Year 6; F:Vulnerability & Risk; F:Science of Team Science; F:Research Frameworks; 2016PF-028; wrong DBI; K:interdisciplinary; K:Disasters; K:epistemology; K:hazards; K:sharing meanings approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article outlines three elements by which religion and environmental inequality are related: the cumulative effect of religious worldviews, free market outlooks held by some religious adherents, and the bridging or bonding character of social ties of religious adherents. These three elements are analyzed by examining the relationship between industrial air pollution and the proportion of population in metropolitan areas that are conservative Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Catholic, and a composite measure. Results show that the composite measure is associated with more industrial pollution. But important distinctions between religious groups show that a greater proportion of conservative Protestant Evangelical adherents are associated with greater pollution, but that Catholic and Mainline Protestant adherents are not.

This paper builds a model that captures the dynamic water balance evolution and coupled human response within the Lake Toolibin catchment in West Australia's wheatbelt region. Two subcatchments in different parts of the landscape were selected to examine the key emergent properties of the coupled socio-hydrology system over a 100 year period, by analyzing the two-way feedbacks of land use management (human system feedback) and land degradation (natural system feedback). Using a relatively simple parameterization of community sensitivity to land degradation within the model, we identified positive and negative feedbacks, the presence of threshold behavior, time scale differences between fast and slow moving variables, differences in time lags resulting from disparate resistance levels of the natural system, and the degree of adaptive learning inherent in the human system. Specifically, the valley floor subcatchment transitioned through four phases—expansion, contraction, recession, and recovery—demonstrating a threshold shift in the human feedback after 60 years, while the upslope subcatchment appears to still be in the contraction phase, with no sign of reaching a threshold shift in 100 years. These results demonstrate that the model is capable of isolating the two-way feedbacks of the coupled system and has implications for resilience theory, suggesting that greater resistance in the underlying natural system counteracts the onset of a negative feedback loop and instigation of adaptive behaviors in the human system.","2015-08","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2023-12-07 17:39:43","","6442–6471","","8","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","61 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KWUDWQ3Y/Elshafei et al. - 2015 - A model of the socio-hydrologic dynamics in a semi.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; 2015; Year 2; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Modeling; 2013T5-001; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; K:land use change; K:water resources management; K:catchment systems model; K:coupled system feedbacks; K:socio-hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These transitions are complex and difficult to predict – the product of water managers acting in response to numerous biophysical, regulatory, political, and financial factors within institutional constraints. Gaining a better understanding of how these transitions occur is crucial for continuing to improve water management. This paper presents a replicable methodology for analyzing how urban water utilities transition toward sustainability. The method combines standardized quantitative measures of variables that influence transitions with contextual qualitative information about a utility's unique decision making context to produce structured, data-driven narratives. Data-narratives document the broader context, the utility's pretransition history, key events during an accelerated period of change, and the consequences of transition. Eventually, these narratives should be compared across cases to develop empirically-testable hypotheses about the drivers of and barriers to utility-level urban water management transition. The methodology is illustrated through the case of the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (WASD) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its transition toward more sustainable water management in the 2000s, during which per capita water use declined, conservation measures were enacted, water rates increased, and climate adaptive planning became the new norm.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:39:43","","891–908","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZQ2EZQG2/Treuer et al. - 2017 - A narrative method for analyzing transitions in ur.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/57569EUM/2016WR019658.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014T9-007; K:Human Ecology; K:methods; K:transitions; K:utilities; K:water management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current green infrastructure (GI) practice aims at mitigating the negative effects of urbanization by restoring pre-development hydrology and ultimately addressing water quality issues at an urban catchment scale. However, the benefits of GI extend well beyond local storm water management, as urban green spaces are also major contributors to human health. Considerable research in the psychological sciences have shown significant human health benefits from appropriately designed green spaces, yet impacts on human wellbeing have not yet been formally considered in GI design frameworks. This work develops a novel computational green infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates storm water management requirements with criteria for human wellbeing. A supervised machine-learning model is created to identify specific patterns in urban green spaces that promote human wellbeing; the model is linked to RHESSYS hydrological model to evaluate GI designs in terms of both water resource and human health benefits. An application of the framework to tree-based GI design in Dead Run Watershed, Baltimore, MD, shows that image-mining methods are able to capture key elements of human preferences that could improve GI design. The results also show that hydrologic benefits associated with tree-based features are substantial, indicating that increased urban tree coverage and a more integrated GI design approach can significantly increase both human and hydrologic benefits.","2019-08","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:39:43","","252-261","","","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KF2KSYHR/Rai et al. - 2019 - A novel computational green infrastructure design .pdf","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 2; 2019; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Modeling; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Engineering & Design; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Research Frameworks; 2013V-018; K:Computer vision; K:Green stormwater infrastructure; K:Human preference; K:hydrologic modeling; K:Hydrology; K:Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven soil nitrogen measures were compared because different irrigation and fertilization practices may vary between front and backyards, which may alter nitrogen cycling in soils. In addition to lawn-only measurements, we collected and analyzed plant species richness for entire yards—cultivated (intentionally planted) and spontaneous (self-regenerating)—for front and backyards in just two cities: LA and SLC. Lawn plant species and soils were not different between front and backyards in our multi-city comparisons. However, entire-yard plant analyses in LA and SLC revealed that frontyards had significantly fewer species than backyards for both cultivated and spontaneous species.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 166 studies in naturally regenerating and actively restored forests worldwide to answer: (1) To what extent do floral and faunal abundance and diversity and biogeochemical functions recover? (2) Does recovery vary as a function of past land use, time since restoration, forest region, or precipitation? (3) Does active restoration result in more complete or faster recovery than passive restoration? Overall, forests showed a high level of recovery, but the time to recovery depended on the metric type measured, past land use, and region. Abundance recovered quickly and completely, whereas diversity recovered slower in tropical than in temperate forests. Biogeochemical functions recovered more slowly after agriculture than after logging or mining. Formerly logged sites were mostly passively restored and generally recovered quickly. Mined sites were nearly always actively restored using a combination of planting and either soil amendments or recontouring topography, which resulted in rapid recovery of the metrics evaluated. Actively restoring former agricultural land, primarily by planting trees, did not result in consistently faster or more complete recovery than passively restored sites. Our results suggest that simply ending the land use is sufficient for forests to recover in many cases, but more studies are needed that directly compare the value added of active versus passive restoration strategies in the same system. Investments in active restoration should be evaluated relative to the past land use, the natural resilience of the system, and the specific objectives of each project.","2017-02","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:39:42","2021-11-29 15:44:37","e0171368","","2","12","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","228 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/K2656G55/Meli et al. - 2017 - A global review of past land use, climate, and act.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YTKZF4AZ/Meli et al. - 2017 - A global review of past land use, climate, and act.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MZDUB32K/article.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/C7JE56H5/article.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; 2017; Pursuit; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; K:biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Governance & Natural Resources; Year 3; K:biogeochemistry; T:Disturbance; K:meta-analysis; K:forest ecology; K:forests; K:land use; 2013T7-015; K:forest recovery; K:Forest restoration; K:forestry; K:planting; K:temperate forests; K:meta-analyses; K:metanalysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This framework emphasizes the process of problem-solving and is based on socio-environmental (S-E) synthesis, an integrative, transdisciplinary approach to understanding and tackling complex socio-environmental problems. In addition to identifying the knowledge, skills, dispositions, and practices necessary for S-E problem-solving at the undergraduate and graduate levels, we clarify how one draws on such competencies to inquire about problems and generate solutions for them.

Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy—the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)—dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the “territoriality benefits” hypothesis—where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.","2020-06","2020-11-17 20:30:00","2023-12-07 17:39:42","","e1007457","","6","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CWR38MEE/White et al. - 2020 - A mechanistic, stigmergy model of territory format.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SWETDHGF/article.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Modeling; T:Disease & Pests; K:emerging infectious diseases; K:population ecology; 2018PF-040; K:epidemiology; K:disease modeling; K:animal behavior; K:animal sociality; K:behavioral ecology; K:disease ecology; K:pathogens","","Matthew (Matt) Ferrari","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding how trends could evolve over the course of the 21st century is crucial for scientists and decision-makers from local to global scales. Scenario analysis is the primary tool for doing so, and has been applied across all major environmental issues, including nitrogen pollution. However, to date most scenario efforts addressing nitrogen flows have either taken a narrow approach, focusing on a singular impact or sector, or have not been integrated within a broader scenario framework —a missed opportunity given the multiple environmental and socio-economic impacts that nitrogen pollution exacerbates. Capitalizing on our expanding knowledge of nitrogen flows, this study introduces a framework for new nitrogen-focused narratives based on the widely used Shared Socioeconomic Pathways that include all the major nitrogen-polluting sectors (agriculture, industry, transport and wastewater). These new narratives are the first to integrate the influence of climate and other environmental pollution control policies, while also incorporating explicit nitrogen-control measures. The next step is for them to be used as model inputs to evaluate the impact of different nitrogen production, consumption and loss trajectories, and thus advance understanding of how to address environmental impacts while simultaneously meeting key development goals. This effort is an important step in assessing how humanity can return to the planetary boundary of this essential element over the coming century.","2020-03","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:39:42","","102029","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2020; Year 7; T:Modeling; T:Pollution; 2017C17-025; F:Research Frameworks; K:environmental policy; K:nitrogen pollution; K:scenario analysis; K:scenarios; K:Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, conservation actions have been increasingly informed by ever more sophisticated quantitative models. These models have focused primarily on ecological and geographic elements of conservation problems, such as mark-recapture methods, predicting species occurrences, and optimizing the placement of protected areas. There are many off-the-shelf ecological models for conservation managers to draw upon, but very few that describe human-nature interactions in a generalizable manner. We address this gap by proposing a minimalistic modeling framework for human-nature interactions, combining well-established ideas in economics and social sciences (grounded in Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework) and accepted ecological models. Our approach begins with a systems breakdown consisting of an ecosystem, resource users, public infrastructure, and infrastructure providers; and interactions between these system elements, which bring together the biophysical context, the relevant attributes of the human society, and the rules (institutions, such as protected areas) currently in use. We briefly review the different disciplinary building blocks that the framework could incorporate and then illustrate our approach with two examples: a detailed analysis of the social-ecological dynamics involved in managing South African protected areas and a more theoretical analysis of a general system. We conclude with further discussion of the urgent need in conservation biology for models that are genuinely designed to capture the complexities of human socioeconomic behavior, rather than the more typical approach of trying to adapt an ecological model or a stochastic process to simulate human agency and decision-making. Our framework offers a relatively simple but highly versatile way of specifying social-ecological models that will help conservation biologists better represent critical linkages between social and ecological processes when modeling social-ecological dynamics.","2022-10","2022-10-24 19:17:19","2023-12-07 17:39:41","2022-10-24 19:17:19","109769","","","275","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GEXTK89I/Anderies et al. - 2022 - A framework for conceptualizing and modeling socia.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2H5W24S3/S0006320722003226.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; Year 7; F:Actionable Research; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2022; F:Research Frameworks; 2017C16-003; K:Conservation policy; K:Coupled infrastructure systems; K:Dynamic modeling; K:Social ecological systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the majority of applications, human behaviour is represented by the rational actor model despite growing empirical evidence of its shortcomings in NRM contexts. While the importance of accounting for the complexity of human behaviour is increasingly recognized, its integration into formal models remains a major challenge. The challenges are multiple: i) there exist many theories scattered across the social sciences, ii) most theories cover only a certain aspect of decision-making, iii) they vary in their degree of formalization, iv) causal mechanisms are often not specified. We provide a framework- MoHuB (Modelling Human Behavior) - to facilitate a broader inclusion of theories on human decision-making in formal NRM models. It serves as a tool and common language to describe, compare and communicate alternative theories. In doing so, we not only enhance understanding of commonalities and differences between theories, but take a first step towards tackling the challenges mentioned above. This approach may enable modellers to find and formalize relevant theories, and be more explicit and inclusive about theories of human decision making in the analysis of social-ecological systems.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:26","2023-12-07 17:39:41","","21–35","","","131","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","253 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WBJNBSBP/Schlüter et al. - 2017 - A framework for mapping and comparing behavioural .pdf","","2017; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; K:behavior; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Modeling; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; F:Research Frameworks; K:modeling; 2013PF-008; 2013T7-013; K:behavioral; K:bounded rationality; K:descriptive norm; K:habitual; K:human decision-making; K:prospect theory; K:rational actor; K:reinforcement learning; K:theory of planned behavior; Year 3 (ABC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early attempts to quantify water security relied on static index-based approaches that failed to acknowledge that human action is intrinsic to the water cycle. Human adaptation to environmental change and increasing spatial specialization in the modern world necessitate a more flexible and dynamic view of water security. Starting from first principles, and through application of simple water balance concepts to human-impacted water systems, we first develop a set of indicators for water insecurity. We then offer an approach to model these indicators as outcomes of coupled human-water systems to anticipate watershed trajectories under human impacts, predict water insecurity, and inform appropriate action. In this way, far from being a static index, water security signifies a “safe operating subspace” within a three-dimensional space that maps physical resource availability, infrastructure, and economic choices.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:39:41","","12-20","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","112 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TGZLDWFK/Srinivasan et al. - 2017 - A dynamic framework for water security.pdf","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; Year 2; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Actionable Research; 2013T5-001; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:socio-hydrology; K:dynamic framework; K:human-water systems; K:Integrated Water Resources Management; K:IWRM; K:regime shifts; K:sustainable development goals; K:water security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intentional and unintentional poisoning, human-wildlife conflict, energy infrastructure, belief-based use, and illegal hunting activities remain threats to vulture populations across Africa. Conservation stakeholders have identified evidence that a number of vulture species in particular ecosystems are being systematically targeted by poisoning with potentially significant effects on human, wildlife, and ecosystem health. We explored the extent to which an interdisciplinary, expert team-based approach linking conservation and criminology could help inform efforts to prevent poisoning of Africa’s vultures. We used the case of illegal vulture poisoning and conservation in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area (GLTFCA), a known poisoning site, as an exemplar. We used an interdisciplinary framework, conservation criminology, to guide a desk assessment of how the local environment may create opportunities for illegal poisoning. Our assessment was conducted as a science team and included multiple iterations and structured discourse. The assessment identifies different elements of vulture poisoning and the opportunity factors that can both underly the problem and inform prevention strategies and tactics. We discuss controlling tools and weapons, extending local guardianship, denying benefits, reducing frustration and stress, and assisting compliance to help prevent illegal poisoning. Results provide insights into harm prevention using evidence-based theory and illustrate the positive potential of interdisciplinary team science for vulture conservation. With additional application, monitoring and evaluation, strategies and tactics explored in this desk assessment may be revised and implemented and portend other benefits for vulture conservation beyond poisoning; the spread of beneficial influence could be a welcome force multiplier for this important scavenger guild.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:39:41","","e01076","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; 2020; T:Team Science & Collaborations; Year 6; F:Research Frameworks; K:community-based conservation; 2016C15-005; T:Wildlife; K:birds; K:criminology; K:elephants; K:human-wildlife conflict; K:ivory; K:lions; K:scavengers; K:wildlife crime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike most conservation action models, an important attribute of our framework is the integration of multiple factors related to both human motivations and animal vulnerability into feedbacks. We apply our framework to two case studies, tigers in Laos and wolverines in northern Sweden, to demonstrate its utility in disentangling some of the complex features of carnivore poaching that may have hindered effective responses to the current poaching crisis. Our framework offers a common platform to help guide future research on wildlife poaching feedbacks, which has hitherto been lacking, in order to effectively inform policy making and enforcement.","2016-11","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:39:33","","251-264","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","67 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9N28ADZ5/Carter et al. - 2017 - A conceptual framework for understanding illegal k.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; Venture; 2016; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Policy & Regulation; 2014V-026; 2013PF-009; K:carnivores; K:feedbacks; K:Gulo gulo; K:Panthera tigris; K:poaching; K:tiger; K:tigers; K:wolverine; K:wolverines; Year 3 (NC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rank abundance curves (RACs) potentially integrate these existing methodologies by detailing species-level community changes. Here, we had three goals: first, to simplify analysis of community dynamics by developing a coordinated set of R functions, and second, to demystify the relationships among univariate, multivariate, and RACs measures, and examine how each is influenced by the community parameters as well as data collection methods. We developed new functions for studying temporal changes and spatial differences in RACs in an update to the R package library (“codyn”), alongside other new functions to calculate univariate and multivariate measures of community dynamics. We also developed a new approach to studying changes in the shape of RAC curves. The R package update presented here increases the accessibility of univariate and multivariate measures of community change over time and difference over space. Next, we use simulated and real data to assess the RAC and multivariate measures that are output from our new functions, studying (1) if they are influenced by species richness and evenness, temporal turnover, and spatial variability and (2) how the measures are related to each other. Lastly, we explore the use of the measures with an example from a long-term nutrient addition experiment. We find that the RAC and multivariate measures are not sensitive to species richness and evenness and that all the measures detail unique aspects of temporal change or spatial differences. We also find that species reordering is the strongest correlate of a multivariate measure of compositional change and explains most community change observed in long-term nutrient addition experiment. Overall, we show that species reordering is potentially an understudied determinant of community changes over time or differences between treatments. The functions developed here should enhance the use of RACs to further explore the dynamics of ecological communities.","2019-10","2020-11-17 20:34:32","2023-12-07 17:39:20","","","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","72 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TGIL9QEJ/Avolio et al. - 2019 - A comprehensive approach to analyzing community dy.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/J9FHXFKW/ecs2.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; Year 5; 2019; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; K:R package; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2015PF-018; K:R code; K:multivariate analysis; K:codyn; K:community composition; K:long-term data; K:richness; K:spatial variability; K:temporal variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study of places, landscapes, and regions links the two fields. Architecture can be shaped and enhanced by the long-term cultural and geographic perspective afforded by archaeology; architecture can offer archaeology a ride into the future. We hope that our efforts are novel enough to be inspiring and connected enough to allow existing concepts to be furthered. The bridge unites three domains: material, social, and aesthetic. We look to the past to find material technologies—new engineering and conceptual solutions to an array of problems—and the past obliges with many examples. However, these technologies in their material aspects are only part of the story. The archaeologist sees them as playing a role in a system. This system, while mechanically functional, is also profoundly social: it includes administrative structures, but also innumerable other kinds of relationships—kin groups, neighborhoods, genders—that mirror the embedded relations between humans and nature. As in architecture, systems include semantics and aesthetics: not only are these forms pleasing to the eye, but they also tell stories of history and place and give identity and meaning to the lives in which they are enmeshed. This multi-functionality and multi-vocality are inherent in past systems.","2022-07","2022-09-01 19:32:10","2023-08-01 19:26:12","2022-09-01 19:32:10","","","","","","","If the Past Teaches, What Does the Future Learn?","","","","","TU Delft","","en-US","","","","","","","DOI: 10.47982/BookRxiv.32","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KV86STLU/32.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; Foundation; reported to NSF; Year 7; 2022; T:Environmental History; K:archaeology; K:urban planning; 2018F-011; K:history; K:landscape design; K:regional planning; T:ecology","","Murphy, John T.; Crumley, Carole L.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collectively, our team examined eight cases of cancelled or stalled infrastructure projects in the Americas, drawing from our experiences in academic research and professional practice. We gathered at the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) in Annapolis, Maryland for a three-day meeting motivated by the question: How has the world been shaped by infrastructure projects that have been cancelled or stalled? Our group synthesis process included responding to common questions about each case to establish interconnections, and facilitated discussion to identify themes. Across cases, we found that projects were cancelled or stalled for interrelated reasons including environmental impact assessments, litigation and legislation, strong opposition and media attention, and/or increasing costs and faltering justifications. Our work further shows that cancelled or stalled development projects can create socio-environmental consequences that persist and cascade over time. The consequences of unbuilt infrastructure projects include the following: the development of new research networks; the establishment of precedents for socio-environmental assessment; the strengthening of social movements, often against the proposed development; changes in land use and land tenure; the exposure of environmental racism and injustice; and shifted development interventions. In sum, paying attention to cancelled and stalled projects provides a transdisciplinary lens for understanding broader processes of development, knowledge, power, science, and socio-environmental change. We conclude that when proposed large infrastructure projects are assessed, additional attention needs to be given to how they may shape landscapes and societies even if they are never built.","2022-08","2022-08-30 17:23:00","2023-08-01 19:25:36","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Y5LXQ455/Graef et al. - How Is the World Shaped by Infrastructure Projects.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; F:Built Environment; T:Economics; T:Human Geography; Foundation; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Policy & Regulation; Year 9; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2022; T:Disturbance; T:Environmental History; 2019F-013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many animal behaviors, including social interactions, mating displays, and decisions about where to move, nest, and forage are shaped by interactions with parasites. The same is true for humans, where our attraction to mates, hygienic behaviors, foodchoices, and decisions about when and where to gather in groups often depend on current and perceived infection risk. In turn, behaviors like social distancing and self-medication can alter the trajectories of parasite transmission and evolution, as vividly illustrated by the ongoing COVID-19pandemic. The myriad connections between animal behavior and parasitism have been the subject of growing research interest since the 1970s and 80s, when fundamental theories linking the two fields of study emerged. Since then, a combination of conceptual and technological advances, and increased integration of ideas across disciplines, have helped to uncover fascinating new connections between animal behavior and the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. This accessible text surveys emerging research in this vibrant field. Chapters focus on fundamental topics at the interface of animal behavior and parasitism, and authors have been selected to provide a diverse and international perspective. Animal Behavior and Parasitism is an upper-level text suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate level students as well as professional researchers in animal behavior/behavioral ecology, disease ecology, parasitology, and evolutionary biology.","2022-08","2022-08-09 16:07:10","2023-08-01 19:14:58","","","369","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: xSZ_EAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.com/books?id=xSZ_EAAAQBAJ","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; F:Vulnerability & Risk; 2022; T:Disease & Pests; 2018PF-040","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emerging from the streets of the post-industrial city are well-tended community gardens, rooftop farms and other viable habitats capable of supporting native flora and fauna. At the forefront of this transformation are the citizens living in the cities themselves. As people around the world increasingly relocate to urban areas, this book discusses how they engage in urban stewardship and what civic participation in the environment means for democracy. Drawing on data collected through a two-year study of volunteer stewards who planted trees as part of the MillionTreesNYC initiative in the United States, this book examines how projects like this can make a difference to the social fabric of a city. It analyses quantitative survey data along with qualitative interview data that enables the volunteers to share their personal stories and motivations for participating, revealing the strong link between environmental stewardship and civic engagement. As city governments in developed countries are investing more and more in green infrastructure campaigns to change the urban landscape, this book sheds light on the social importance of these initiatives and shows how individuals’ efforts to reshape their cities serve to strengthen democracy. It draws out lessons that are highly applicable to global cities and policies on sustainability and civic engagement.","2016-04","2022-08-09 20:21:44","2023-07-07 17:23:17","2022-08-09 20:21:44","","132","","","","","Urban Environmental Stewardship and Civic Engagement","View All Book Series  BOOK SERIES Routledge Explorations in Environmental Studies","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NJFAIZXJ/9781138689558.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; T:Ecology; 2016; Fellow; T:Human Health & Well-Being; Year X; 2012F-001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, most decisions affecting ecosystems have relied on ecological assessments with little or no consideration of the value of ecosystem services. Best practice for ecosystem services assessments is to apply quantitative measures and methods that express both an ecosystem’s capacity to provide valued services and, through those services, social benefit (value). Although preference evaluation methods are well established, their implementation can be infeasible because of time or resource constraints, particularly when new data need to be collected. In such cases, the minimum standard recommended for an ecosystem services assessment is to use measures that go beyond narrative description and that are carefully constructed to reflect the ecosystem’s capacity to provide benefits to society but that stop short of a formal assessment of people’s preferences. These measures of ecosystem services are benefit-relevant indicators (BRIs). Their use ensures that ecosystem services assessments measure outcomes that are demonstrably relevant to human welfare, rather than biophysical measures that might not be relevant to human welfare. If ecosystem service values or BRIs are not used in some manner, ecosystem services are not being assessed, and no direct insights can be drawn about effects on social welfare. This minimum best practice is broadly achievable across agencies and decision contexts with current capacity and resources.","2015-07","2022-07-26 15:58:38","2023-06-16 20:47:28","2022-07-26 15:58:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Text","","","","","Last Modified: 2019-07-02T09:13-04:00 Publisher: Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, Duke University","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DYS9ELXQ/best-practices-integrating-ecosystem-services-federal-decision-making.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Year 4; T:Economics; 2015; T:Sustainability; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Natural Resource Management; Workshop; F:Actionable Research; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2015W-044","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By analyzing historical societies as complex adaptive systems, we contribute to contemporary thinking about societal-environmental interactions in policy and planning and consider how environmental and climatic changes, whether sudden high impact events or more subtle gradual changes, impacted human responses in the past. We ask how societal perceptions of such changes affect behavioral patterns and explanatory rationalities in premodernity, and whether a better historical understanding of these relationships can inform our response to contemporary problems of similar nature and magnitude, such as adapting to climate change.","2022-07","2023-06-12 18:54:57","2023-06-13 00:30:22","2023-06-12 18:54:57","","","","","","","Perspectives on Public Policy in Societal-Environmental Crises","Risk, Systems and Decisions","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-94137-6","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XH8CMWIQ/Izdebski et al. - 2022 - Perspectives on Public Policy in Societal-Environm.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; T:Synthesis Research; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; Year 9; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2022; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; T:Environmental History; T:Political Science; K:sustainable development; 2019C21-011; K:Ecological change; K:History; K:Open Access; K:Social History","","Izdebski, Adam; Haldon, John; Filipkowski, Piotr","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approximately two thirds of this biome are located within Brazilian territory. There, socio-economic and environmental landscape transformations are linked to the regional agrarian economy dynamics, which has developed into six techno-productive trajectories (TTs). These TTs are the product of the historical interaction between Peasant and Farmer and Rancher practices, technologies and rationalities. This article investigates the distribution of the dominant Brazilian Amazon TTs and their association with environmental degradation and vulnerability to neglected tropical diseases. The goal is to provide a framework for the joint debate of the local economic, environmental and health dimensions. We calculated the dominant TT for each municipality in 2017. Peasant trajectories (TT1, TT2, and TT3) are dominant in ca. fifty percent of the Amazon territory, mostly concentrated in areas covered by continuous forest where malaria is an important morbidity and mortality cause. Cattle raising trajectories are associated with higher deforestation rates. Meanwhile, Farmer and Rancher economies are becoming dominant trajectories, comprising large scale cattle and grain production. These trajectories are associated with rapid biodiversity loss and a high prevalence of neglected tropical diseases, such as leishmaniasis, Aedes-borne diseases and Chagas disease. Overall, these results defy simplistic views that the dominant development trajectory for the Amazon will optimize economic, health and environmental indicators. This approach lays the groundwork for a more integrated narrative consistent with the economic history of the Brazilian Amazon.","2021-07","2023-06-06 16:47:48","2023-06-06 17:04:59","2023-06-06 16:47:48","","","","9","","","Epidemiology, Biodiversity, and Technological Trajectories in the Brazilian Amazon","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HUFJYSB2/Codeço et al. - 2021 - Epidemiology, Biodiversity, and Technological Traj.pdf","","T:Landscapes at Risk; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 7; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2021; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2017C17-012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the statutory requirements for federal agencies to incorporate public input in their siting decisions combined with the greater political efficacy of wealthier, more educated communities has the potential to lead to inequities in their distribution. In this paper, we show that the likelihood of a community receiving a nearby fuels management project is greater for wealthier, whiter, and more educated communities, even after controlling for differences in risk from wildfire. We further investigate the CLFRP, a cost-share program operated by the US Forest Service. Communities near CLFRP projects tend to have higher socioeconomic status. However, participation in cost-share programs does not appear to depend critically on wealth since we find no difference in the wealth of communities near CLFRP projects compared to all US Forest Service fuels projects, including those with no matching requirements. Rather, the racial makeup and educational attainment of communities is more strongly associated with nearby cost-share projects.","2022-05","2022-06-08 12:48:37","2023-03-08 15:52:02","2022-06-08 12:48:37","","","","","","","Unequal Treatments","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2GJEX22R/Anderson et al. - 2022 - Unequal Treatments Federal Wildfire Fuels Project.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Risk; T:Vulnerability; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2022; T:Disturbance; 2014T10-007; K:Adaptive governance; K:demographics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this report, we focus on the kinds of civic innovation in the United States that engage everyday citizens, diverse communities, and multiple professional and institutional stakeholders in collaborative work to enhance climate resilience, environmental justice, and democratic legitimacy. Our focus on civic and collaborative forms of engagement by no means implies that other policy toolkits or movement repertoires are less important or any less urgent. Indeed, we stress the need to align a wide array of policy tools to achieve optimal mixes and we appreciate varied blends of contention and collaboration to empower youth and communities. While many tools are needed, civic and collaborative engagement is a vital and indispensable part of the mix and will increase in significance as the disruptive impacts of climate change on communities intensify over the next several decades. To leverage civic innovation occurring in many community and institutional settings, we draw upon “policy design for democracy” as this has emerged in scholarly studies in recent years, as well as upon collaborative governance practices at all levels of the federal system. Policy design can provide resources, tools, and signals that enable and incentivize engagement by community groups and civic associations to mobilize their own assets and local knowledge and to work in partnership with professional and institutional stakeholders to solve public problems. Policy design can also help institutionalize forms of civic initiative and autonomy that are nonetheless accountable to public officials and network partners, capable of learning and revision, and that generate sufficient democratic legitimacy to sustain constructive work amidst the extraordinary complexity and uncertainty entailed by climate change in the coming years. In our democratic polity, already severely stressed along many fronts including the culture and politics of climate, we cannot afford to ignore or minimize civic work that generates practical collaboration for sustained community resilience. Indeed, we are presented with extraordinary opportunity to engage our diverse citizenry in noble and effective work. We survey 12 areas where civic innovation and policy design have direct relevance to sustainable communities, climate resilience, and environmental justice and where the lineaments of capacity building have become increasingly clear.","2022-10","2023-01-06 20:50:44","2023-01-06 21:07:05","","115","","","","","","Civic Engagement in American Climate Policy","","","","","Tufts University","CivicGreen","English","","","","","","","","","","","no acknowledgment; Year 1; Foundation; T:Climate Change; T:Sustainability; T:Synthesis Research; F:Actionable Research; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2022; 2012F-001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accelerating rate of change compounds the global social-ecological challenges already deemed “wicked” due to conflicting goals and scientific uncertainty. Understanding how connected natural and human systems respond to change is essential to understanding the governance required to navigate these modern wicked problems. This Article views change through the lens of complexity and resilience theories to inform the challenges of governance in a world dominated by such massive and relentless disruption. The new theories of governance discussed in this Article have been developed through empirical observation of emerging governance innovation to fill governance gaps that have opened with the increasing complexity of society. Among them, adaptive governance has been described as emerging in environmental governance and described in the resilience literature as a promising means to manage modern wicked problems. Adaptive governance is observed to emerge, and does so, in situations of conflict with high uncertainty in environmental management outcomes. This Article contributes to the development of adaptive governance theory by articulating and situating the role of formal law and government as the facilitator, but not central controller, of adaptive governance. To advance the understanding of adaptive governance, we argue that it can be understood in the broader context of scholarship covering the observed emergence of new governance, the efforts to develop theoretical understandings through decentered theory, and the refinement of constitutional understanding through democratic experimentalism. Synthesis of these three themes in turn informs the role of law and government in working with emergent governance responses to complexity to manage change and wicked problems. This inter- and transdisciplinary exercise reveals that the role of law and government in adaptive governance is to leave space for local innovation and private governance. Law and government must provide the catalyzation, facilitation, steering, and oversight essential for public and private institutions to respond at the rate and complexity of change in large-scale social-ecological systems, and they must do so while advancing good governance.","2020-12","2022-11-14 14:28:01","2022-11-14 19:46:14","","46","","6","73","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4ZW8W2ZP/Cosens et al. - Designing Law to Enable Adaptive Governance of Mod.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; 2020; Workshop; Year 7; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; wrong DBI; 2017W-070; K:Adaptive governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carrico Agriculture is a small but key economic sector globally, providing food security and livelihoods for millions, with upwards of half of household incomes in some regions. Farming is inherently reliant on environmental conditions and thus high risk. Despite this, development of the agricultural sector is widely viewed as one of the better ways for improving the lives of many of the world’s poor, facilitating upward social and economic mobility. Climate change, however, threatens farms and farmers, who will need to adapt. Social capitals, broadly conceived, are often thought of as a sort of social safety net and may include things like support, trust and cohesion. Social capitals can help farmers respond and adapt to changing conditions and have been widely explored in agricultural contexts across multiple disciplines. Relatively few studies, however, incorporate multiple measures or levels of social capital, and the range of outcome variables considered within smallholding agriculture settings is relatively narrow.  Using data from two household surveys and diverse statistical approaches, I explore how multiple measures of social capital (support, trust, cohesion, ties) are correlated with farmer knowledge and adoption of potentially adaptive on-farm practices, changes to agricultural livelihoods, and farm and farmer well-being. I also consider how social capital intersects with migration, another critically important livelihood strategy in agricultural settings. In doing so, I examine the significance of social ties to migrants on agricultural livelihoods and well-being. Throughout this work, I find support for the importance of social capitals for farmers, but the conditions and contexts vary. In Chapter 2, I find that multiple dimensions of social capital positively predict on-farm adaptation practices. In Chapter 3, results revealed that households that have sent a migrant are significantly less likely to leave agricultural livelihoods. Results in Chapter 4 complicate some of these findings, revealing that social capital is sometimes positively predictive and sometimes negatively predictive of agricultural outcomes and farmer well-being. These findings may be of interest for food and agriculture development programs, for both rural and urban planners (related to migration), and for researchers in fields such as sociology, anthropology, health, and social and environmental psychology, and for broad programs whose focus is on sustainable development.","2022-01","2022-01-28 18:56:11","2022-09-15 19:12:14","2022-01-28 18:56:11","","","","","","","The Effects of Social Capital and Migration on Agricultural Practices and Well-Being among Farmers in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GFXYTSCK/1.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Social Science; K:behavior; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Agriculture; Year 8; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2021; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2018GS6-008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"I6LA46GL","thesis","2022","Cannon, Sara","Coral reef ecology and conservation in the tropical Pacific Ocean","","","","","https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0417523","Both local and global stressors threaten coral reefs, putting the food security, cultural continuity, and livelihoods of millions of reef-dependent people at risk. Still, scientists lack an understanding of how climate-driven heat stress interacts with local stressors such as fishing and pollution to influence reef health. Coral reef communities in the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, both low-lying atoll nations in the central Pacific, offer an opportunity to examine these interactions. The Gilbert Islands of Kiribati, which straddle the equator, experience highly variable sea surface temperatures (SSTs) inter-annually due to El Niño / Southern Oscillation, driving coral bleaching events in 2004/2005 and 2009/2010, while the Marshall Islands further north of the equator experience more stable SSTs. Both nations are home to degraded reefs near their capitol atolls, which host over half of each country’s populations. I first analyzed the benthic trajectories of coral reefs in the Gilbert Islands from 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018, across a gradient of local human disturbance after multiple stressors, including two heat stress events and an outbreak of the corallivorous Crown-of-Thorns (CoTs) starfish, finding that locally degraded reefs were more resistant to heat stress than less trafficked reefs because the former were home to hardier taxa. Next, comparing locally disturbed and undisturbed reefs in Kiribati to those in the Marshalls demonstrated that the interactions between local and global stressors were context-dependent; the taxa that were present dictated the interactions. Then, via a meta-analysis of 1,205 sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, I demonstrated that a proxy often used to assess the effects of local human disturbance on reef health, the percent cover of macroalgae, does not correlate with local human disturbance. Instead, different genera of macroalgae exhibited diverse and often opposing responses to various sources of local human disturbance. Finally, I used public archives from an email listserv popular among the coral conservation community to analyze the policy narratives used by participants when discussing local threats to reefs, the actors involved in the local threat, their distal drivers, and the proposed solutions, revealing underlying assumptions about reefs and local people, which could inadvertently undermine conservation.","2022-08","2022-09-15 16:07:40","2022-09-15 17:58:13","2022-09-15 16:07:40","","","","","","","","","","","","University of British Columbia","","eng","","","","","open.library.ubc.ca","","DOI: 10.14288/1.0417523","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JIKUCZ9Q/Cannon - 2022 - Coral reef ecology and conservation in the tropica.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/X6LVF7F3/1.html","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Pollution; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Year 9; T:Fisheries; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2019GS7-002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past decade, participatory visual and narrative arts have been more frequently and effectively incorporated into scenario planning and visioning workshops. We use arts-based techniques in three ways: 1. Incorporating arts language into the process of visioning 2. Delineating eco-aesthetic values of the visual and aural landscape in communities 3. Engaging art to articulate challenges and solutions within local communities. The arts based approaches we use include collage, drawing, visual note taking, map making, storyboarding, photo documentation through shared cameras, mobile story telling, performance in the landscape, drawing as a recording device, and collective mural creation. They allow us to expand and deepen engagement strategies beyond the scope of traditional dialog tools such as opinion surveys, workshops, and meetings. And, they allow for both individual and collective work, from spending reflective time independently, to rejoining as a group to discuss process and products.

Whether modeling the social interactions of individuals within a community in anthropology, the trade-offs of foraging behaviors in ecology, or the influence of warming ocean temperatures on circulation patterns in oceanography, the ability to represent empirical or theoretical understanding through modeling provides scientists with a semi-standardized language to explain how we think the world works. In fact, modeling is such a basic part of human reasoning and communication that the formal practice of scientific modeling has been recently extended to include non-scientists, especially as a way to understand complex and poorly understood socio-environmental dynamics and to improve collaborative research. Although the field of participatory modeling has grown in recent years, there are still considerable questions about how different software tools common to participatory modeling can be used to facilitate communication and learning among diverse groups, which approaches are more or less suitable (given the nature of a community or environmental issue), and whether these approaches effectively lead to action-oriented outcomes.","","2022-08-08 20:40:36","2022-08-09 20:26:02","2022-08-08 20:40:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DZBWSB82/modelling-is-the-language-of-scientific-discovery.html","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; 2015; 2015T11-012; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Team Science & Collaborations; T:Modeling; F:Science of Team Science; K:modeling; K:participatory modelling; K:particpatory modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, how humans perceive and judge the presence of such species, or how they judge an ecosystem or landscape change triggered by them, is not fixed or easy to define. Here, some of the psychological, cognitive, and social dimensions that influence how humans judge non-native and invasive species and their effects on ecosystems are reviewed.

Qualitative data is increasingly being used in socio-environmental systems research and related interdisciplinary efforts to address complex sustainability challenges. There are many scientific, descriptive and material benefits to be gained from sharing and re-using qualitative data, some of which reflect the broader push toward open science, and some of which are unique to qualitative research traditions. However, although open data availability is increasingly becoming an expectation in many fields and methodological approaches that work on socio-environmental topics, there remain many challenges associated the sharing and re-use of qualitative data in particular.    This white paper discusses opportunities, challenges, resources and approaches for qualitative data sharing and re-use for socio-environmental research. The content and findings of the paper are a synthesis and extension of discussions that began during a workshop funded by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) and held at the Center Feb. 28-March 2, 2017. The structure of the paper reflects the starting point for the workshop, which focused on opportunities, challenges and resources for qualitative data sharing, and presents as well the workshop outputs focused on developing a novel approach to qualitative data sharing considerations and creating recommendations for how a variety of actors can further support and facilitate qualitative data sharing and re-use.    The white paper is organized into five sections to address the following objectives:   (1) Define qualitative data and discuss the benefits of sharing it along with its role in socio-environmental synthesis;  (2) Review the practical, epistemological, and ethical challenges regarding sharing such data;  (3) Identify the landscape of resources available for sharing qualitative data including repositories and communities of practice   (4) Develop a novel framework for identifying levels of processing and access to qualitative data; and   (5) Suggest roles and responsibilities for key actors in the research ecosystem that can improve the longevity and use of qualitative data in the future.","2018","2022-07-19 17:41:14","2022-07-19 18:29:15","2022-07-19 17:41:14","","","","","","","Qualitative data sharing and re-use for socio-environmental systems research","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","drum.lib.umd.edu","","Accepted: 2018-01-17T20:34:51Z","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KIVUF4L6/Jones et al. - 2018 - Qualitative data sharing and re-use for socio-envi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/E4W3AUXU/20257.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; Workshop; Year 6; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Research Frameworks; 2016PF-023; K:data sharing; Year 6 (SA); 2016W-060; K:data re-use; K:data reuse; K:Qualitative analysis; K:qualitative data; K:qualitative research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"DK2SEUKL","thesis","2021","Hastings, Zoe","Understanding the potential for restoration through agroforestry in Hawai'i","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/10125/81621","Agriculture is a major driver of global environmental change. Restorative practices like agroforestry, that integrate native and non-native, culturally important plants while mimicking the structure and function of native forests have the potential to increase biodiversity and ecosystem services of conventionally managed and fallow agricultural lands. However, what the potential is of restoring these lands using agroforestry and who is able to participate in agroforestry transitions remains a question. I focus on agroforestry transitions in Hawaiʻi, where a long history of Indigenous agroforestry and more recent interest in biocultural restoration provide an important context for understanding equitable pathways to agroforestry today. In the first chapter, I show how integrating co-production of knowledge with functional trait approaches to designing restoration and agroforestry research with local stakeholders can lead to more inclusive and scalable results. In the second chapter, I apply this approach to an experimental restoration that asks, 1) do initial measures of restoration success (i.e., understory composition, understory cover, and mid- and over-story survival) vary between treatments over the first two years, and if so, are these treatment effects mediated by other drivers, and 2) how does the ecological condition of the site compare to pre-restoration? Based on plant community metrics, the results show that non-native forests have a high potential for restoration through agroforestry, and this provides an important first step in documenting what non-native forest to agroforest transitions can look like. The third chapter is a state-wide study, in which I ask, what factors drive and/or restrain transitions to agroforestry, and who is able to participate? I found that agroforestry practitioners are motivated to restore ecosystems and reclaim sovereignty, not just by the direct or practical benefits of agroforestry. Practitioners’ values often conflict with the values of dominant funders, landowners, and other institutions, which produces unique obstacles. Access to off-site resources that are inequitably distributed often determines who can persist despite the obstacles. Taken together, the findings in this dissertation highlight the significant opportunity to restore conventionally managed and fallow agricultural lands through agroforestry and the need for structural change to ensure equitable access to the opportunity presented by these land use transitions.","2021-12","2022-03-17 15:37:58","2022-06-14 21:17:15","2022-03-17 15:34:19","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Hawai'i at Manoa","","English","","PhD Dissertation","","","","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/F98QTWKU/Hastings_hawii_0085A_11226.pdf","","Grad Pursuit; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Year 9; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2021; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:political ecology; 2019GS7-005; K:agroecology; K:biocultural restoration; K:functional traits; K:Indigenous and local knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seen as the preferred approach to global food security issues, ‘sustainable intensification' is the enhancement of crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts and preserving the ability of future generations to use the land. It is still unclear to what extent sustainable intensification would allow humanity to meet its demand for food commodities. Here we use the footprints for water, nitrogen, carbon and land to quantitatively evaluate resource demands and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of future agriculture and investigate whether an increase in these environmental burdens of food production can be avoided under a variety of dietary scenarios. We calculate average footprints of the current diet and find that animal products account for 43–87% of an individual's environmental burden—compared to 18% of caloric intake and 39% of protein intake. Interestingly, we find that projected improvements in production efficiency would be insufficient to meet future food demand without also increasing the total environmental burden of food production. Transitioning to less impactful diets would in many cases allow production efficiency to keep pace with growth in human demand while minimizing the food system's environmental burden. This study provides a useful approach for evaluating the attainability of sustainable targets and for better integrating food security and environmental impacts.","2016-07","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:41:01","","125–132","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","255 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IAKB7W6V/Davis et al. - 2016 - Meeting future food demand with current agricultur.pdf","","no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; T:Agriculture; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; Workshop; 2016; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; Fellow; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; Year 6 (JG); K:Sustainable intensification; 2019W-080; K:Dietary change; K:Food revolution; K:Footprint; K:Future food demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But are ecologists measuring the right things and presenting the right evidence to enable such alignment? We articulate key concerns of growers, conservation groups, and governments with regards to implementing conservation biological control at the landscape scale and argue that if ecologists want to gain more traction, we need to reconsider what we measure, for what goals, and for which audiences. A wider set of landscape objectives that ecologists should consider in our measurements include risk management for growers and co-benefits of multifunctional landscapes for public actors. Ecologists need to shift our paradigm toward longer-term, dynamic measurements, and build cross-disciplinary understanding with socioeconomic and behavioral sciences, to enable better integration of the objectives of these diverse actors that will be necessary for landscape management for conservation biocontrol to achieve its full potential.","2019-08","2020-11-17 20:34:39","2023-12-07 17:41:01","","60","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TCZUMVUU/Chaplin-Kramer et al. - 2019 - Measuring What Matters Actionable Information for Conservation Biocontrol in Multifunctional Landscapes.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QP9J3LMK/Chaplin-Kramer et al. - 2019 - Measuring What Matters Actionable Information for.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; 2019; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Team Science & Collaborations; T:Ecology; Venture; F:Actionable Research; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; T:Disease & Pests; K:ecosystem services; K:stakeholders; 2013V-021; K:decision-support; K:natural enemies; K:pest control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We acoustically tagged 34 red drum, and mapped sand, seagrass, marsh, or oyster (across discrete landscape contexts) use by each uniquely coded individual. Using 144,000 acoustic detections, we recorded differences in habitat use among red drum: proportional use of seagrass habitat ranged from 0 to 100%, and use of oyster-bottom types also varied among fish. WIC/TNW and IS metrics (previously applied vis-à-vis diet specialization) consistently indicated that a typical red drum overlapped >70% with population-level niche exploitation. Monte Carlo permutations showed these values were lower than expected had fish drawn from a common habitat-use distribution, but longitudinal comparisons did not provide evidence of temporally consistent individuality, suggesting that differences among individuals were plastic and not reflective of true specialization. Given the range of acoustic detections we captured (from tens to 1,000s per individual), which are substantially larger sample sizes than in many diet studies, we extended our findings by serially reducing or expanding our data in simulations to evaluate sample-size effects. We found that the results of null hypothesis testing for specialization were highly dependent on sample size, with thresholds in the relationship between sample size and associated P-values. These results highlight opportunities and potential caveats in exploring individuality in habitat use. More broadly, exploring individual specialization in fine-scale habitat use suggests that, for mobile marine species, movement behaviors over shorter (≤weeks), but not longer (≥months), timescales may serve as an underlying mechanism for other forms of resource specialization.","2015-05","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:01","","75–87","","1","178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 25669451","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/22FWM3MA/Fodrie et al. - 2015 - Measuring individuality in habitat use across comp.pdf","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; 2015; Postdoc; T:Ecology; T:Ocean & Marine Life; 2014PF-015; K:foraging theory; K:individual specialization; K:landscape context; K:niche variation; K:Scieanops ocellatus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, temporary streams and rivers are being degraded at alarming rates owing to development, hydromorphological alteration, and disposal of waste water, among other stressors, and pressure will likely increase under global change. Here we propose that it is key to manage temporary streams and rivers as a unique ecohydrological type and not as a permanent waterway or a terrestrial ecosystem. Nevertheless, two challenges hinder this goal. First, data availability on intermittent low regimes and associated biotas is currently scarce. As a consequence, flow-ecology relationships in temporary waterways are largely unknown, and appropriate metrics to define and monitor their ecological status are missing. Second, the ecological and social values of temporary streams and rivers are often underestimated, being regarded as secondary ecosystems relative to permanent waterways. To conserve temporary streams and rivers, ecologists need to define them as unique ecosystems and conservation targets, and practitioners need to systematically collect biological and hydrological data in these ecosystems. Innovative approaches at the intersection of ecology, citizen science, and management, can also contribute to their management and conservation by: i) mapping them, ii) informing people about their ecological values, iii) safeguarding them from further human threats, iv) preserving their flow regime when managing reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants, and water abstraction activities, and v) restoring physically-degraded temporary reaches (e.g. due to gravel mining and off-road use) or reaches that have lost historical flows due to increasing drought severity, diversions, and groundwater overuse.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:00","","12-19","","Part B","211","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","78 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3Y4T3TWN/Acuña et al. - 2017 - Managing temporary streams and rivers as unique ra.pdf","","2017; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Year 6; F:Water & People; Fellow; 2016PF-025; K:ecosystem management; K:Flow intermittency; K:Freshwater biodiversity conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now, however, environmental managers in cities have managed invasive species using approaches and paradigms developed for a rural context, despite the radically different socio-environmental conditions that prevail in cities. We examine the case of Cape Town, South Africa, a rapidly growing metropolitan centre within a global biodiversity hotspot and a developing country, to underline the considerable challenges and complexities of managing invasive species in cities.

In addition, we found that ‘AMR as One Health' constitutes a recent framing of the topic that seeks to provide an integrated understanding between human and animal health. Each frame originates in distinct scientific fields, conceptualises the main causes of AMR and prioritises different interventions and measurements.

Furthermore, anthropogenic impacts such as coastal development and fishing can have drastic effects on the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Scientists need to account for environmental variation and human impacts to accurately model, manage, and conserve marine ecosystems. Although there are many types of environmental data available from global remote sensing and open-source data products, some are inaccessible to potential end-users because they exist as global layers in high temporal and spatial resolutions which require considerable computational power to process. Additionally, coastal locations often suffer from missing data or data quality issues which limit the utility of some global marine products for coastal sites. Herein we present the Marine Socio-Environmental Covariates dataset for the global oceans, which consists of environmental and anthropogenic variables summarized in ecologically relevant ways. The dataset includes four sets of environmental variables related to biophysical conditions (net primary productivity models corrected for shallow-water reflectance, wave energy including sheltered-coastline corrections) and landscape context (coral reef and land cover within varying radii). We also present two sets of anthropogenic variables, human population density (within varying radii) and distance to large population center, which can serve as indicators of local human impacts. We have paired global, summarized layers available for download with an online data querying platform that allows users to extract data for specific point locations with finer control of summary statistics.

Failure to recover from the economic crash of 2008 is not due just to inadequate fiscal and monetary policies. The continuing global crisis is also due to scarcity of critical resources. Our macroecological studies highlight the role in the economy of energy and natural resources: oil, gas, water, arable land, metals, rare earths, fertilizers, fisheries, and wood. As the modern industrial-technological-informational economy expanded in recent decades, it grew by consuming the Earth's natural resources at unsustainable rates. Correlations between per capita GDP and per capita consumption of energy and other resources across nations and over time demonstrate how economic growth and development depend on ""nature's capital"". Decades-long trends of decreasing per capita consumption of multiple important commodities indicate that overexploitation has created an unsustainable bubble of population and economy.","2014-04","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:40:59","","24-32","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISBN: 0925-8574","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/65AKZ96J/Brown et al. - 2014 - Macroecology meets macroeconomics Resource scarci.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/43Z6T9FR/S0925857413003236.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; T:Sustainability; Year 2; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Ecology; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2013; 2012PF-004; K:Ecological economics; K:Economic growth; K:Global sustainability; K:Macroecology; K:Resource scarcity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several recent studies of the fossil diatom record of the last ~ 150 years in Andean lakes have shown changes in diatom species composition that suggest changes in lake thermal structure in response to regional climate warming. Yet these paleolimnological records are only a few hundred years in length, so it is unclear whether the systems have entered new states, with potentially severe consequences for ecosystem structure and function, or whether current trends are within the natural variability of the systems. Here, we use a recently compiled diatom database from tropical South America to explore the regional distribution and ecological controls of selected planktic diatom taxa that are associated with warming and changes in the lake thermal structure. We also review published Andean stratigraphic records that span thousands of years to characterize the long-term dynamics of relevant planktic species in response to past climate change. The contemporary data show that many planktic taxa have broad latitudinal and elevational distributions. The distributions of several taxa are correlated with surface water temperature, but most also are correlated with pH and/or conductivity. A review of existing stratigraphic data from Andean lakes demonstrates that rapid changes in diatom abundance, including abrupt increases followed by decades to centuries of near extirpation, are a common mode of population variation for some planktic taxa. Yet the majority of these published paleolimnological investigations are of lakes that are larger and differ in nutrient status and conductivity from the small dilute systems where recent species shifts have been observed. We propose that assessing the resilience of contemporary diatom communities and, by inference, lake ecosystems is best done by generating new records from Andean lakes of varied size and chemistry that span a millennium or more and hence a broader spectrum of climate conditions, coupled with new ecological and biogeographic studies that build upon ongoing research programs in the tropical Andes.","2018-09","2020-11-17 20:30:29","2023-12-07 17:40:59","","251-262","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RKDLIZL5/Fritz, Benito, Steinitz-Kannan - 2018 - Long-term and regional perspectives on recent change in lacustrine diatom communities in the tro.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Environmental History; K:diatoms; K:Andes; K:Historical ecology; K:lake; K:paleoecology; K:tropics; K:warming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true within small island developing states that often have limited capacity for monitoring activities that could inform policy decisions. This study estimates the spatial distribution of fishing activity in the data-poor nearshore reef fisheries of Barbados using low cost interview surveys of fishers combined with a geospatial platform. With data from over 150 fishers in the island's major reef fisheries, the estimated total annual yield ranged from 272.6 to 409.0 mt, with seine fishing accounting for 65% of landings. This estimate is substantially higher than the recorded landings in official databases. Fishing activity is concentrated on the sheltered and heavily populated West Coast of the island. Reef fishing effort decreases markedly during the months associated with the offshore pelagic fishery season, as many fishers switch fisheries during this time and rough sea conditions restrict access to the nearshore windward reefs. The high levels of fishing intensity and low yields per unit of reef area appear to validate anecdotal evidence that the nearshore reefs of Barbados are heavily overexploited. The qualitative nature of interview data and other data gaps hinder the precise estimation of fishing effort and yield, where relative values are likely to be more accurate than absolute values. Nonetheless, the spatially and temporally explicit data generated here demonstrates how simple cost-effective methods can be used to fill important information gaps for marine resource management and spatial planning.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:40:59","","198-207","","","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HFMGQ9DC/Gill et al. - 2019 - Making the most of data-poor fisheries Low cost m.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FUWWEUIV/S0308597X17302312.html","","Year 4; 2017; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Actionable Research; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:Coral reefs; 2014PF-011; K:Qualitative analysis; K:Cost-effective methods; K:Data-poor fisheries; K:Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries; K:Small island developing states; K:Small-scale fisheries; K:survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Demand for animal source foods has more than tripled over the past 50years due to population growth and dietary change. As a result, the livestock sector has transitioned towards intensive and concentrated production systems. Typically, studies have divided types of animal production into intensive, mixed and grazing production systems. However, because a large percentage of animal production originates from mixed systems, dividing by such production types can make it difficult to quantify competition for crop production between direct human consumption and use as feed. To this end we employ a calorie-based approach to determine which animal calories were ‘free' – in that they did not compete with human consumption for crop use – and consider to what extent alternative scenarios could have reduced this competition between food and feed. We find that growth in non-feed animal systems has only been able to keep pace with population growth and that feed-fed production has necessarily met increases in human dietary demand for animal products. Through solutions such as moderating diets for animal calories, choosing less resource-demanding animal products and maintaining the relative contribution of non-feed systems, between 1.3 and 3.6 billion fewer people would be in competition with feed for crop use. We also estimate that the feed crop calories required to support consumer waste of animal calories could feed an additional 235 million people. With human demand for animal products expected to continue increasing in the coming decades, the findings here provide insights into potential solutions and what the magnitude of their effect may be and suggest that there exist real opportunities for humankind to substantially reduce competition for crop use.","2015-12","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:40:58","","817–823","","","538","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/S6RKIYPW/S0048969715306288.html","","no acknowledgment; 2015; T:Sustainability; T:Agriculture; Fellow; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:Food waste; K:Dietary change; K:Feed crops; K:Human demand; K:Livestock intensification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that tropical forests have a strong cooling effect throughout the year; temperate forests show moderate cooling in summer and moderate warming in winter with net cooling annually; and boreal forests have strong warming in winter and moderate cooling in summer with net warming annually. The spatiotemporal cooling or warming effects are mainly driven by the two competing biophysical effects, evapotranspiration and albedo, which in turn are strongly influenced by rainfall and snow.

Understanding the timing and causes of these historical extinctions can be beneficial to identifying and preventing contemporary biodiversity loss, as well as understanding the nature of island ecosystems. Tristan da Cunha (henceforth “Tristan”), the most remote inhabited island in the world, has lost three species from the main island since permanent human settlement in 1811—the Tristan Moorhen (Gallinula nesiotis), Inaccessible Finch (Nesospiza acunhae acunhae), and Tristan Albatross (Diomedea dabbenena). We used recently developed Bayesian methods, and sightings of mixed certainty compiled from historical documents, to estimate the extinction date of these three species from Tristan based on specimens. We estimate that all three species were likely extirpated from Tristan between 1869 and 1880 following a period of significant habitat alteration and human overexploitation, and only the albatross had a high probability of persistence when Black Rats (Rattus rattus) arrived in 1882, the previously assumed cause of extinction for all three species. Better estimates of extinction dates are essential for understanding the causes of historical biodiversity loss, and the combination of historical ecology with modern statistical methods has given us novel insights into the timing and therefore the causes of extinctions on one of the most isolated islands in the world.","2018-08","2020-11-17 20:30:30","2023-12-07 17:40:58","","49-60","","","160","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/48UIBYVK/Bond, Carlson, Burgio - 2018 - Local extinctions of insular avifauna on the most remote inhabited island in the world.pdf","","2018; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; Year 8; T:Disturbance; K:extinction; K:Historical ecology; 2018PF-057; K:bird; K:Diomedeidae; K:Rallidae; K:Thraupidae; K:Tristan da Cunha","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over many generations, Arctic peoples have developed a wide range of behavioral strategies to navigate environmental change and uncertainty, and these strategies provide a foundation for contemporary adaptation. Aims In this article, we focus on mixed cash-subsistence economies and the social networks that underlie them in Alaska. The patterns of food production, labor exchange, and food sharing in subsistence-oriented communities throughout Alaska are driven by the productivity of keystone households who regularly harvest and share resources within and between communities. Materials & Methods Building on previous research suggesting the critical importance of these networks to community resilience, we use network analysis to investigate whether patterns in resource transfers between households are associated with subsistence harvest diversity—the diversity of species harvested by a household unit. We use exponential random graph models to describe the structure of a sharing network from Aniak, Alaska, and model the links between harvest productivity, harvest diversity, and household position in this network. Results Our results indicate that both productivity and diversity are positively associated with network connections, and that productivity alone provides an incomplete model of network structure. Discussion We suggest that subsistence harvest diversity may play a unique role in supporting adaptive capacity and resilience by maintaining the productivity of keystone households despite changing environments and sustaining social network structures that circulate resources throughout the community. Harvest diversity may also serve as a broad indicator of Indigenous ecological knowledge and a tangible representation of cultural practices, values, and worldviews that underlie subsistence in Alaska. Conclusion Greater attention to harvest diversity is important for understanding how subsistence networks adapt to environmental change and uncertainty linked to social and ecological dynamics of anthropogenic climate change.","2021-02","2021-02-11 13:38:20","2023-12-07 17:40:57","2021-02-11 13:55:51","","","4","33","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","","","","Wiley Online Library","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3HTADS6S/Scaggs et al. - Linking subsistence harvest diversity and producti.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PTXXZ7II/ajhb.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EULCYHN3/ajhb.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554415","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; Year 2; Postdoc; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; 2021; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:social networks; 2012PF-001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species’ presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA.

In such a tightly connected world, goods and services consumed in one country are often produced in other countries and exchanged by international trade. Teleconnection is a concept from atmospheric sciences referring to climate phenomena being related to one another at large distances. Recently, this idea has been used to represent the virtual shrinking of distances between places, the strengthening of connectivity between distant locations, and, at the same time, the growing separation between places of consumption and production (Hubacek et al. 2014). Thus, consumption is increasingly met by global supply chains that often involve large geographical distances. As such, local consumption can have negative impacts on both the local and global environment, contributing to climate change, pollution, water scarcity, deforestation, and other land conversions, all of which impact important ecosystem services. Local decisions, through these global supply chains, potentially contribute and reinforce global inequalities and exploitation. People in high-income countries maintain more resource-intensive lifestyles, whereas people in low-income countries often bear the environmental and social consequences. More aware social and environmental decision making as well as adaptation and mitigation to climate change require a better understanding of such economic and environmental linkages. We need sophisticated tools to assess the range of environmental and social implications of our choices across spatial and temporal scales. Although research in this area has already begun, there are a number of areas where new research and theoretical guidance is needed—primarily through innovative linking of the local to the global. The goal of this special issue, “Linking Local Consumption to Global Impacts,” is to bring together different approaches and data sets to account for and analyze drivers of globalization, inequalities in consumption, income and wealth, and their social and environmental impacts across temporal and spatial scales by explicitly linking the local to the global. Twenty-one articles are included in this special issue. They provide an interesting overview of industrial ecology research dealing conceptually and empirically with coupling consumption and/or production and their environmental, economic, and social impacts over various scales. We find a wide range of approaches, combinations of methods and data sets. There are also a number of interesting applications and reflections on transdisciplinary science approaches to include stakeholders and other users of our research. The articles link consumption and/or production activities to a wide range of environmental impacts, such as water, energy and land use, various pollutants, and economic and social indicators, such as child labor, social costs of carbon, and loss of human life. We organized the discussion of the articles into three major, although partly overlapping, categories in this editorial: environmental impacts of economic sectors; environmental impacts of (household) consumption; and social impacts of consumption and production.

The aim of this work was to assess the future implications of these processes on land use/land cover and biodiversity in northwest Iberia. To achieve our goal, we developed a virtual spatially explicit dynamic model to simulate regional socio-ecological dynamics. For the period between 1960 and 2040, we tested four different environmental scenarios ranging from small decreases in conifer forest and a stabilization of agricultural areas and shrublands to more radical shifts, substantial decreases in agricultural areas and massive expansion of eucalyptus stands. The model considers also fire, whose role increased significantly in the scenarios of expanded forests. Bird assemblages, which we used as a surrogate for biodiversity, showed complex patterns although with overall decreases in richness and abundance. Species with narrow niche and from Mediterranean open habitats were particularly sensitive to the ongoing changes simulated. Our results suggest that landscape management actions and planning assessments designed for conserving biodiversity should focus on the maintenance of the traditional agricultural mosaic combined with a regulatory legislation limiting the expansion of fast growing tree forests (e.g Eucalyptus stands). This strategy can contribute to maintaining a diversity of land use/land cover in a heterogeneous landscape and the prevention of the occurrence of large wildfires, fundamental for the implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans.","2016-05","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:40:57","","85–100","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/M67US7D3/S1574954116300358.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Agriculture; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; 2016; Year 3; T:Disturbance; K:Agent-based models; 2013T7-006; K:Biological conservation; K:Bird community; K:Farmland; K:Forest; K:scenario modeling; K:Socio-ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Managers can use information about specific environmental features that people value, and how these might change under different management scenarios, to spatially target actions to areas of high current or potential value. We explored how snorkelers' experience would be affected by separate and combined land and marine management actions in West Maui, Hawaiʻi, using a Bayesian belief network (BBN) and a spatially explicit ecosystem services model. The BBN simulates the attractiveness of a site for recreation by combining snorkeler preferences for coastal features with expert opinions on ecological dynamics, snorkeler behavior, and management actions. A choice experiment with snorkelers elucidated their preferences for sites with better ecological and water-quality conditions. Linking the economic elicitation to the spatially explicit BBN to evaluate land-sea management scenarios provides specific guidance on where and how to act in West Maui to maximize ecosystem service returns. Improving coastal water quality through sediment runoff and cesspool effluent reductions (land management), and enhancing coral reef ecosystem conditions (marine management) positively affected overall snorkeling attractiveness across the study area, but with differential results at specific sites. The highest improvements were attained through joint land-sea management, driven by strong efforts to increase fish abundance and reduce sediment; however, the effects of management at individual beaches varied.","2020-11","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:40:57","","106788","","","177","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W22TYGXI/S0921800920302706.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Ecosystem Services; 2020; Year 6; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; 2016C14-003; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:Bayesian belief network; K:Hawai‘I; K:Hawaii; K:Land-sea interactions; K:Management scenario evaluation; K:Recreational ecosystem service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major part of successfully implementing demand management strategies is understanding the community-specific attitudes and beliefs that may influence uptake of conservation behaviors. Here, we present results from a study aimed at understanding these community-specific attitudes and beliefs towards water conservation. In particular, we leverage survey data from three cities in the Southwestern United States and a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm to determine seven key archetypes of water consumers. These archetypes can be used to determine demand management strategies that might have greater (or lesser) success.

Although recent research has focused on intra‐specific variation in traits themselves, it is the influence of this variation on plant performance that makes intra‐specific trait variation relevant to ecological dynamics within or among species. Understanding the links between trait and performance variation, and the role of traits in mediating relationships among multiple components of performance, is critical for assessing the importance of intra‐specific trait variation for community dynamics. Seed size is thought to affect aspects of plant performance including fecundity, seedling growth, dispersal and tolerance of natural enemies. For two tropical tree species, we assessed how seed size was related to performance variation within each species and determined whether intra‐specific trait variation mediates intra‐specific performance tradeoffs. We used field seed rain collection to characterize size‐dependent outcomes of dispersal, sowed seeds of known size in soil collected near or far from conspecifics to characterize susceptibility to soil pathogens, and monitored growth of seedlings from seeds of known size. We found that intra‐specific seed size variation caused intra‐specific performance variation. The degree of trait‐based performance variation was consistently smaller than the degree of trait variation, and seed size influenced different components of performance for each species. One species exhibited a tradeoff in which small seeds had a fecundity advantage (more seedlings per unit reproductive mass) but produced smaller seedlings, whereas the other species exhibited a tradeoff in which small seeds dispersed to areas of low conspecific density but were less tolerant of density‐responsive natural enemies. Our results indicate that a single trait can influence multiple components of performance and can mediate different tradeoffs in co‐occurring species. Complex and heterogeneous effects of a single trait in multidimensional niche space may favour inter‐specific niche differentiation and coexistence.","2019-07","2020-11-17 20:30:13","2023-12-07 17:40:56","","1716-1725","","12","128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IJRZYYCC/Fricke, Tewksbury, Rogers - 2019 - Linking intra‐specific trait variation and plant function seed size mediates performance tradeoffs wi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/X96HW23W/Fricke et al. - 2019 - Linking intra-specific trait variation and plant f.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7CEJY3PK/oik.html","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; 2019; Year 8; T:Ecology; K:community ecology; 2018PF-037; K:seed dispersal; K:functional traits; K:coexistence; K:intra-specific variation; K:Janzen–Connell effects; K:plant biology; K:seed mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in other degraded forested peatlands more broadly.","2018-12","2020-11-17 20:34:47","2023-12-07 17:40:56","","342–351","","1972","233","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Academic Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Q6534H3A/Schulte et al. - 2018 - Linking ecosystem function and hydrologic regime to inform restoration of a forested peatland.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5P63PCHJ/Schulte et al. - 2019 - Linking ecosystem function and hydrologic regime t.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CSILCJ5D/S0301479718314646.html","","2018; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; F:Actionable Research; T:Disturbance; 2017PF-034; K:hydrology; K:Forested wetlands; K:Great Dismal Swamp; K:Peat; K:Red maple; K:Restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing primarily on papers from the special issue and other key NCA literature, we identify lessons learned and gaps remaining for NCA’s development and application to decision making. In doing so, we identify eight key similarities and three major differences in NCA development, status, and application between the U.S. and EU. NCA can be highly policy relevant: special issue papers address critical issues including agriculture, water, conservation/land-use planning, climate, and corporate decision making. In both the U.S. and EU, further application is needed to drive demand for the accounts’ production.

In this paper we compare seven of these projects and draw conclusions regarding their potential benefits and the challenges that scholars can expect in conducting this type of research. The two main challenges that we identified are (1) the collective-action dilemmas that collaborators face in producing and maintaining the social and technical infrastructure that is needed for such projects; and (2) balancing complexity and comparability in the structure of the databases used and the associated methods for characterizing complex social-ecological cases. We discuss approaches for meeting these challenges, and present a guiding checklist of questions for project design and implementation to provide guidance for future broadly comparative research.","2018-02","2021-06-23 19:32:12","2023-12-07 17:40:55","2021-06-23 19:32:12","","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 by the author(s)","","","","www.ecologyandsociety.org","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PIRHCYL4/Cox et al. - 2021 - Lessons learned from synthetic research projects b.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/G3TX5VA5/Cox et al. - 2021 - Lessons learned from synthetic research projects b.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4RV86G8I/Cox et al. - 2021 - Lessons learned from synthetic research projects b.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/L37VZGBJ/art17.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6ZDBWPMF/art17.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MCP8EATI/art17.html","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Team Science & Collaborations; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2021; K:commons; F:Research Frameworks; K:synthesis; 2017C16-003; K:broadly comparative research; K:Ostrom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact.

Properties of adaptive governance are widely studied. However, these studies have not resulted in consolidated frameworks for legal and institutional design, limiting our ability to promote adaptation and social-ecological resilience. We develop an overarching framework that describes the current and potential role of law in enabling adaptation. We apply this framework to different social-ecological settings, centers of activity, and scales, illustrating the multidimensional and polycentric nature of water governance. Adaptation typically emerges organically among multiple centers of agency and authority in society as a relatively self-organized or autonomous process marked by innovation, social learning, and political deliberation. This self-directed and emergent process is difficult to create in an exogenous, top-down fashion. However, traditional centers of authority may establish enabling conditions for adaptation using a suite of legal, economic, and democratic tools to legitimize and facilitate self-organization, coordination, and collaboration across scales. The principles outlined here provide preliminary legal and institutional foundations for adaptive environmental governance, which may inform institutional design and guide future scholarship.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:40:55","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CPYMLUNK/DeCaro et al. - 2017 - Legal and institutional foundations of adaptive en.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PLKWLXMX/art32.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; Year 2; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:environmental law; K:water governance; F:Research Frameworks; 2013T5-006; K:adaptive governance; K:design principles; K:social-ecological resilience; K:State-reinforced self-governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet leakage—when deforestation is pushed to other regions—may dilute the global effectiveness of regionally successful policies. Here we show that domestic leakage offsets 43-50% of the avoided deforestation induced by existing and proposed zero-deforestation supply chain policies in Brazil’s soy sector. However, cross-border leakage is insignificant (<3%) because soybean production is displaced to existing U.S. farmland. Eliminating deforestation from the supply chains of all firms exporting Brazilian soy to the EU or China from 2011-2016 could have reduced net global deforestation by 2% and Brazilian deforestation by 9%. Thus, if major tropical commodity importers (e.g., the EU) require traders to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, it could help bend the curve on global forest loss.","2022-09","2022-09-22 19:18:27","2023-12-07 17:40:54","2022-09-22 19:18:27","5476","","1","13","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2022 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JGA3P7AH/Villoria et al. - 2022 - Leakage does not fully offset soy supply-chain eff.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H3DKQ9RZ/s41467-022-33213-z.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; Pursuit; 2016C13-002; 2018PF-038; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; Year 8 (FG); T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Policy & Regulation; 2022; K:Forestry; K:Agriculture; K:Economics; no acknowledgement to FG funding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public health professionals and other experts broadly agree about actions needed to address such threats, but implementation of this advice is stymied by systemic factors such as prejudice, resource deficits, and high inequality. In these cases, crises like epidemics may be viewed as opportunities to spark structural changes that will improve future prevention efforts. However, crises can also weaken governance and reinforce systemic failures. In this paper, we use the concept of the governance treadmill to demonstrate cross-level dynamics that help or hinder the alignment of capacities toward prevention during public health crises. We find that variation in capacities and responses across local, national, and international levels contributes to the complex evolution of global and local health governance. Where capacities are misaligned, effective local prevention of global pandemic impacts tends to be elusive in the short term, and multiple cycles of crisis and response may be required before capacities align toward healthy governance. We demonstrate that this transition requires broader societal adaptation, particularly towards social justice and participatory democracy.","2022-03","2022-03-29 13:55:20","2023-12-07 17:40:54","2022-03-29 13:55:20","3683","","6","14","","","Learning from the Past","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Number: 6 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GQKDN4HG/Webster et al. - 2022 - Learning from the Past Pandemics and the Governan.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/26HS6GY5/htm.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Pursuit; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2022; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:pandemics; 2016C15-013; K:Adaptive governance; K:crisis rebound effect; K:governance treadmill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Higher education programs should deploy effective pedagogical approaches to train students in interdisciplinary, team research collaboration. This paper discusses the design of three learning modules that supported the development of collaboration and teamwork skills among doctoral students during an IR workshop held in 2017 at the University of Texas at El Paso. The module activities were scaffolded to provide multiple opportunities for students to develop knowledge about the impacts that individual dispositional characteristics and differences in epistemological philosophies can have on teamwork processes. The activities and the workshop overall created opportunities for the students to apply this knowledge in a variety of authentic, collaborative contexts. An inquiry approach to pedagogical practice was used to address two key questions: (1) Did the learning modules increase knowledge of the impact of sharing dispositional features of team members on the practice of IR? (2) How confident were workshop participants in their ability to adapt to dispositional and epistemological diversity during future IR team activities? Results from a post-workshop questionnaire data, group reflections, and retrospective pre- and post-assessment showed (1) participants learned and practiced essential collaborative skills in authentic contexts; (2) the modules were valued and helped participants recognize the important role that personal dispositional characteristics have on the development of effective IR teams; (3) participants' confidence in adapting to differences among team members increased; and (4) participants recognized that effective collaboration is an emergent property of a team that benefits from the overall intentionality of using a defined process and communication strategy.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:40:54","","1–17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 2; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; F:Support for Teaching & Training; T:Education/Pedagogy; 2020; T:Team Science & Collaborations; F:Fundamentals of Socio-Environmental Systems & Research; 2013T6-002; K:collaboration; K:dispositional characteristics; K:dispositional distance; K:dispositional learning; K:EMBeRS; K:interdisciplinary research skills; K:teamwork","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of these interactions are mediated by institutions (e.g., rules, laws, customs, traditions), most of which are themselves spatially defined entities that both generate and respond to spatial variation in the landscape. However, the spatial dynamics of the interplay between institutions and landscape heterogeneity are poorly understood. Objective: To define the landscape ecology of institutions as an emerging research field, providing a summary of key themes and frontiers. Methods: We draw on existing theory in both landscape ecology and institutional analysis to explore the interface between landscape ecology and institutions in social-ecological systems. Results: Three central themes in understanding landscape sustainability through an institutional lens include the role of landscape heterogeneity as a driver of institutions; the spatial properties of institutions as influences on ecological and socioeconomic processes; and the relationships between institutions and landscape resilience. Emerging frontiers for further research include understanding the roles of top-down vs bottom up processes (design vs. emergence); understanding landscapes as institutional filters; the role of landscapes in institutional development and change; and co-evolutionary dynamics between landscapes and institutions. We discuss each of these points in detail. Conclusions: Spatially mediated feedbacks between landscape structure and institutions are poorly understood and critical for landscape sustainability. Further research in this area will depend heavily on generating data sets that describe the spatial properties of institutions and allow them to be analysed as landscape features.","2020-03","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:40:54","","1–16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8RB2T6NT/Cumming and Epstein - 2020 - Landscape sustainability and the landscape ecology.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; 2020; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:institutional analysis; K:heterogeneity; K:law; T:Political Science; 2017C16-003; K:feedbacks; K:landscape change; K:management emergence; K:spatial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These new data require a rewriting of our narratives of the past, questioning what constitutes an authoritative historical source and who is entitled to recount history to contemporary societies. Humanities-based historical inquiry must embrace this new evidence, but to do so historians need to engage with it in a critical manner, just as they engage critically with textual and material sources. This article highlights the most vital methodological issues, ranging from the spatiotemporal scales and heterogeneity of the new evidence to the new roles attributed to quantitative methods and the place of scientific data in narrative construction. It considers areas of study where the palaeosciences have “intruded” into fields and subjects previously reserved for historians, especially socioeconomic, climate, and environmental history.

Insufficient data about urban expansion hinders effective land use planning. Therefore, a high need to collect, process, and disseminate land cover data exists. This study focuses on urban land cover change detection using Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing methods to produce baseline information in support for land use planning. We applied a supervised classification of land cover of LANDSAT data from 1987, 2002, and 2017. We mapped land cover transitions from 1987 to 2017 and computed the net land cover change during this time. Finally, we analyzed the mismatches between the past and current urban land cover and land use plans and quantified the non-urban development area lost to urban/built-up. Our results indicated an increase in urban/built-up and bare land cover types, while vegetation land cover decreased. We observed mismatches between past/current land cover and the existing land use plan. By providing detailed insights into mismatches between the regional land use plan and unregulated urban expansion, this study provides important information for a critical debate on the role and effectiveness of land use planning for environmental sustainability and sustainable urban development, particularly in less developed countries.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:40:53","","1313","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NJZPRR8Q/Enoguanbhor et al. - 2019 - Land Cover Change in the Abuja City-Region, Nigeri.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BPN8M996/1313.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; 2018PF-038; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 8; K:regional planning; K:change detection; K:Sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we group similar lake ecosystems as metacommunity units influencing diatom community structure. We assembled a database of 195 lakes from the tropical Andes and adjacent lowlands (8°N–30°S and 58–79°W) with associated environmental predictors to examine diatom metacommunity patterns at two different levels: taxon and functional (deconstructed species matrix by ecological guilds). We also derived spatial variables that inherently assessed the relative role of dispersal. Using complementary multivariate statistical techniques (principal component analysis, cluster analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, Procrustes, variance partitioning), we examined diatom–environment relationships among different lake habitats (sediment surface, periphyton, and plankton) and partitioned community variation to evaluate the influence of niche- and dispersal-based assembly processes in diatom metacommunity structure across lake clusters. The results showed a significant association between geographic clusters of lakes based on gradients of climate and landscape configuration and diatom assemblages. Six lake clusters distributed along a latitudinal gradient were identified as functional metacommunity units for diatom communities. Variance partitioning revealed that dispersal mechanisms were a major contributor to diatom metacommunity structure, but in a highly context-dependent fashion across lake clusters. In the Andean Altiplano and adjacent lowlands of Bolivia, diatom metacommunities are niche assembled but constrained by either dispersal limitation or mass effects, resulting from area, environmental heterogeneity, and ecological guild relationships. Topographic heterogeneity played an important role in structuring planktic diatom metacommunities. We emphasize the value of a guild-based metacommunity model linked to dispersal for elucidating mechanisms underlying latitudinal gradients in distribution. Our findings reveal the importance of shifts in ecological drivers across climatic and physiographically distinct lake clusters, providing a basis for comparison of broad-scale community gradients in lake-rich regions elsewhere. This may help guide future research to explore evolutionary constraints on the rich Neotropical benthic diatom species pool.","2018-07","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:40:53","","7865-7878","","16","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/C2I8DY8K/Benito et al. - 2018 - Lake regionalization and diatom metacommunity stru.pdf","","2018; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; F:Water & People; K:metacommunity; K:dispersal; K:Species traits; K:diatoms; K:latitudinal gradient; K:topographic heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe our use of a multiple-evidence based approach to investigate the causes and consequences of environmental change in a community-protected grassland and its surrounding landscape in the Ethiopian highlands. We explore the interaction of biophysical change (precipitation and vegetation) and social change (political and management institutions), and discuss potential impacts for ecosystem service provisioning. We quantified current distributions of locally defined land use/cover classes using a supervised classification, with an overall accuracy of 87.1%. Local community members then described and ranked the ecosystem services associated with each land class according to their perceived importance for society. Vegetation and precipitation changes were assessed using satellite time series beginning in the early 1980s, while local narratives describe changes back to the 1970s. The knowledge coproduction process brought together ethnographic and remote sensing approaches, revealing both complementary and contradictory findings across knowledge systems. Results with high agreement across knowledge systems clarify and reinforce understanding of certain threats and changes to the area, such as the rapidly declining native forests, the disappearing belg rainy season (p = 0.01), and the impact of insecure land tenure on natural resource extraction. Compelling areas of disagreement point to topics in need of further investigation, including increased attention to the spatial and temporal variability of change across a seemingly homogeneous cultural landscape, and the process of shrub encroachment into the protected grassland.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:40:53","","","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Resilience Alliance, Inc.","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5GI8K8JT/Steger et al. - 2020 - Knowledge coproduction improves understanding of e.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PVT2SY6B/art2.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; Pursuit; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; 2020; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:ecosystem functions; K:grassland; K:remote sensing; 2016C15-007; K:Land cover change; K:co-production; K:ethnographic; K:knowledge systems; K:social science; K:transdisciplinary research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a growing need for field-validated, landscape-scale approaches for classifying wetlands based on their expected degree of hydrologic connectivity with stream networks. This study quantified seasonal variability in surface hydrologic connectivity (SHC) patterns between forested Delmarva bay wetland complexes and perennial/intermittent streams at 23 sites over a full water year (2014-15). Field data were used to develop metrics to predict SHC using hypothesized landscape drivers of connectivity duration and timing. Connection duration was most strongly related to the number and area of wetlands within wetland complexes as well as the channel width of the temporary stream connecting the wetland complex to a perennial/intermittent stream. Timing of SHC onset was related to the topographic wetness index and drainage density within the catchment. Stepwise regression modeling found that landscape metrics could be used to predict SHC duration as a function of wetland complex catchment area, wetland area, wetland number, and soil available water storage (adj-R2 = 0.74, p \textless 0.0001). Results may be applicable to assessments of forested depressional wetlands elsewhere in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern Coastal Plain, where climate, landscapes, and hydrological inputs and losses are expected to be similar to the study area.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:40:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ULF8XQTV/Epting et al. - 2018 - Landscape metrics as predictors of hydrologic conn.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WTYG9C36/hyp.html","","2018; Staff; no acknowledgment; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; K:hydrologic connectivity; GRA; K:watershed; K:geographically isolated wetlands; K:landscape drivers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are usually organized by fishers, non-governmental organizations and governments and are credited as an integral tool for the diffusion and adoption of fisheries management strategies. Despite their numerous perceived benefits within fisheries conservation and management, little research has been conducted on FLEs. This multiple case study addressed the research question: “What are the key characteristics of successful FLEs?” Success metrics were defined during a workshop on FLEs in 2013. For this study, the authors selected six successful FLEs that were presented during the workshop. Documentation of FLEs and key informant interviews with participants and organizers were used as data. The following key elements of successful FLEs emerged from analyses: (1) a clear guiding purpose and flexible objectives, (2) careful and considered selection of participants with diverse professions and conservation beliefs, (3) a mix of activities including giving presentations, conducting site visits, talking with local fishers, spending time on boats or in the water, and participating in cultural activities, and (4) logistical and financial follow-up support, including information dissemination about what participants learned at the FLE.

In this introductory paper, we explore common threads from diverse studies comprising the special issue to highlight key challenges for effective governance of FLR across many different contexts. We discuss enabling factors and conditions that can help to overcome deficiencies in governance processes and outcomes and illustrate how these conditions are linked to the six principles of FLR. We conclude by emphasizing several gaps in understanding how governance arrangements influence the planning, implementation and monitoring of FLR.","2020-07","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:40:52","","104854","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3KQGMUX8/S0264837720303173.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; 2020; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2015C12-015; K:Alignment; K:Coalitions; K:Enabling factors; K:Engagement; K:Institutional arrangements; K:Stakeholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is increasing concern with the water quality of stormwater run-off, in addition to the effects of flooding. Changes in the structure of watersheds and in human behavior are important to improve stormwater quality. These changes often require support for government programs and voluntary actions. Environmental knowledge and social cohesion may be two important factors that affect support for urban watershed improvements. We compared temperate Baltimore, MD and arid Phoenix, AZ to examine the relationships among watershed knowledge and social cohesion and support for taxes or voluntary actions to improve local urban watersheds. We also test two social concepts—the “crowding out” and “snowball” effects. Crowding out effects suggest that government activities will crowd out a willingness to volunteer. Snowball effects suggest that voluntary actions are more likely when they complement existing government activities. Using a telephone survey (n = 3,273), we find that watershed knowledge is positively associated with both taxes and volunteering in Baltimore and had no relationship in Phoenix. Social ties are negatively associated with support for taxes and positively associated with volunteering in both cities. We found evidence for the snowball effect: participants who supported a tax were twice as likely to support volunteering. These findings are relevant to the long term dynamics of urban watersheds because the deterioration or improvement of urban watersheds is critically tied to the willingness and capacity of social actors to intervene.","2020-03","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:40:52","","","","","195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JCB8L3S2/S0169204619304013.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Social Science; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2017PF-031; T:Political Science; K:cohesion; K:Snowball effect; K:social ties; K:Watershed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What is the impact on co-creation when problems are complex, with the following characteristics: difficult to delimit, contested definitions, multiple uncertainties and unresolvable unknowns, constraints on what can be done, and no perfect solution? Co-creation on such problems requires a research mindset that appreciates that stakeholders have an essential role in making complexity evident and that limiting stakeholder involvement also limits the ability to understand and effectively act on complex problems. The Integration and Implementation Sciences (i2S) framework is introduced as a way to systematically take into account multiple stakeholders with multiple relevant inputs. In addition, one specific tool, the research-relevant modified International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) spectrum, is described as a way of exploring stakeholder engagement. For complex problems this modified spectrum can be used to describe different ways of including stakeholders, to reflect on appropriate forms of engagement, as well as to take into account both level of researcher control and different categories of stakeholder groups. A research programme examining the feasibility of prescribing pharmaceutical heroin as a treatment for heroin dependence stimulated thinking about co-creation on complex problems and is used as a practice example to illustrate the points covered.","2019-08","2020-11-17 20:34:39","2023-12-07 17:40:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; Pursuit; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; 2019; T:Team Science & Collaborations; F:Actionable Research; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Science of Team Science; K:stakeholders; K:complexity; 2015T11-005; K:co-creation; K:wicked problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While most researchers agree species extinctions are increasing globally due to human activity, some now argue that species richness at local scales is not declining as many biologists have claimed. This argument stems from recent syntheses of time-series data that suggest species richness is decreasing in some locations, increasing in others, but not changing on average. Critics of these syntheses (like us) have argued there are serious limitations of existing time-series datasets and their analyses that preclude meaningful conclusions about local biodiversity change. Specifically, authors of these syntheses have failed to account for several primary drivers of biodiversity change, have relied on data poor time-series that lack baselines needed to detect change, and have unreasonably extrapolated conclusions. Here we summarize the history of this debate, as well as key papers and exchanges that have helped clarify new issues and ideas. To resolve the debate, we suggest future researchers be more clear about the hypotheses of biodiversity change being tested, focus less on amassing large datasets, and more on amassing high-quality datasets that provide unambiguous tests of the hypotheses. Researchers should also keep track of the contributions that native versus non-native species make to biodiversity time trends, as these have different implications for conservation. Lastly, we suggest researchers be aware of pros and cons of using different types of data (e.g., time-series, spatial comparisons), taking care to resolve divergent results among sources to allow broader conclusions about biodiversity change.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:40:52","","175-183","","","219","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","122 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MM9DUQI6/Cardinale et al. - 2018 - Is local biodiversity declining or not A summary .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LBES5MAP/S000632071732089X.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 6; K:invasion biology; K:extinction; 2016PF-022; K:alpha diversity; K:beta-diversity; K:BIodiversity; K:Biotic homogenization; K:gamma diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Keshif further increases expressiveness through aggregate metrics, absolute/part-of scale modes, calculated attributes, and saved selections, all working in synchrony. Its automated design approach also simplifies authoring of dashboards composed of summaries and individual records from raw data using fluid interaction.

Here, we explore an extension of that concept to biological invasions. We compare biogeographical patterns in native and non-native beetle (Coleoptera) assemblages from around the world to test whether beetle invasions represent a random sample of species or whether some families are more prone to invade than others.  Location: Global.  Methods: Numbers of non-native beetle species established in ten regions worldwide were compared with the land area of each region. The distribution of species among families was compared with the distribution among families for all species native to the same region and with the distribution among families for the global pool of all known beetle species. Ordination analysis was used to characterize differences among native and non-native assemblages based upon the distribution of species among families.  Results: We report a total of 1,967 non-native beetle species across all ten regions, and a classic log–log relationship between numbers of species per region and land area though relationships are generally stronger for native assemblages. Some families (e.g., Dermestidae and Bostrichidae) are over-represented and others (e.g., Carabidae, Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae) are under-represented in non-native assemblages. The distribution of species among families is generally similar among native assemblages with greatest similarities among nearby regions. In contrast, non-native species assemblages are more similar to each other than to native species assemblages.  Main conclusions:  Certain families are over-represented, and others are under-represented in non-native beetle assemblages compared to native assemblages, indicating “invasion disharmony” in the global representation of beetle families. Similarities in composition among non-native assemblages may reflect unobserved associations with invasion pathways and life-history traits that shape invasion success of different insect groups.","2021-07","2022-10-19 18:23:52","2023-12-07 17:40:51","2022-10-19 18:23:52","2050-2062","","11","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.13381","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DT7V944N/Liebhold et al. - 2021 - Invasion disharmony in the global biogeography of .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4ETFVFUW/ddi.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 7; 2021; T:Disease & Pests; K:Non-native species; 2017C17-011; K:Coleoptera; K:composition; K:disharmony; K:family; K:insect; K:invasion; K:native","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Irrigation efficiency and water savings have become watchwords in response to climate-induced hydrological variability, increasing freshwater demand for other uses including ecosystem water needs, and low economic productivity of irrigation compared to most other uses. We identify three classes of unintended consequences, presented here as paradoxes. Ever-tighter cycling of water has been shown to increase resource use, an example of the <i>efficiency paradox</i>. In the absence of effective policy to constrain irrigated-area expansion using ""saved water"", efficiency can aggravate scarcity, deteriorate resource quality, and impair river basin resilience through loss of flexibility and redundancy. Water scarcity and salinity effects in the lower reaches of basins (symptomatic of the <i>scale paradox</i>) may partly be offset over the short-term through groundwater pumping or increasing surface water storage capacity. However, declining ecological flows and increasing salinity have important implications for riparian and estuarine ecosystems and for non-irrigation human uses of water including urban supply and energy generation, examples of the <i>sectoral paradox</i>. This paper briefly considers three regional contexts with broadly similar climatic and water-resource conditions – central Chile, southwestern US, and south-central Spain – where irrigation efficiency directly influences basin resilience. The comparison leads to more generic insights on water policy in relation to irrigation efficiency and emerging or overdue needs for environmental protection.","2014-04","2022-08-08 16:33:09","2023-12-07 17:40:51","2022-08-08 16:33:09","1339-1348","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","hess.copernicus.org","","124 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZAETNASK/Scott et al. - 2014 - Irrigation efficiency and water-policy implication.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BNEWNG9N/2014.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 2; T:Agriculture; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; 2013T5-001; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; 2014; K:irrigation; K:river basins; K:water cycle; K:water cycling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location Worldwide; detailed case study in South Africa. Methods We define four components of invasion debt: the number of species not yet introduced but likely to be introduced in the future given current levels of introduction/propagule pressure; the establishment of introduced species; the potential increase in area invaded by established species (including invasive species); and the potential increase in impacts. We demonstrate the approach in terms of number of species for 21 known invasive Australian Acacia species globally and estimate three components of invasion debt for 58 Acacia species already introduced to South Africa by quantifying key invasion factors (environmental suitability, species invasion status, residence time, propagule pressure, spread rate and impacts). Results Current global patterns of invasive species richness reflect historical trends of introduction – most acacia species that will become invasive in southern Africa have already invaded, but there is a substantial establishment debt in South and North America. In South Africa, the likely consequence of invasion debt over the next 20 years was estimated at: four additional species becoming invasive with an average increase of 1075 km2 invaded area per invasive species. We estimate that this would require over US$ 500 million to clear. Main conclusions Our results indicate that invasion debt is a valuable metric for reporting on the threats attributable to biological invasions, that invasion debt must be factored into strategic plans for managing global change, and, as with other studies, they highlight the value of proactive management. Given the uncertainty associated with biological invasions, further work is required to quantify the different components of invasion debt.","2016-04","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2023-12-07 17:40:51","","445–456","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","145 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/AUAUKY7B/Rouget et al. - 2016 - Invasion debt – quantifying future biological inva.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KT45PH2N/ddi.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; C:Case Study; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecology; 2016; F:Vulnerability & Risk; Year 3; 2013T7-006; K:Acacia; K:climatic suitability; K:Invasion debt; K:Invasive; K:lag phase; K:risk assessment; K:species richness","","Ingolf Kühn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surprisingly, microbial invasions have received less attention. Although microbes share many of the features associated with competition between larger-bodied organisms, they also exhibit distinctive behaviors that require new mathematical treatments to fully understand invasions in microbial systems. Most notable is the possibility for long-distance interactions, including competition between taxa mediated by diffusible toxins and cooperation among individuals of a single taxon using quorum sensing. In this paper, we model bacterial invasion using a system of coupled partial differential equations based on Fisher's equation. Our model considers a competitive system with diffusible toxins that, in some cases, are expressed in response to quorum sensing. First, we derive analytical approximations for invasion speeds in the limits of fast and slow toxin diffusion. We then test the validity of our analytical approximations and explore intermediate rates of toxin diffusion using numerical simulations. Interestingly, we find that toxins should diffuse quickly when used offensively, but that there are two optimal strategies when toxin is used as a defense mechanism. Specifically, toxins should diffuse quickly when their killing efficacy is high, but should diffuse slowly when their killing efficacy is low. Our approach permits an explicit investigation of the properties and characteristics of diffusible compounds used in non-local competition, and is relevant for microbial systems and select macroscopic taxa, such as plants and corals, that can interact through biochemicals.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:40:51","","290-303","","","420","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XEKDI3NZ/Bewick et al. - 2017 - Invasion speeds in microbial systems with toxin pr.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4VVS8D4E/S0022519317300358.html","","2017; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Ecology; 2016PF-027; Year 6; F:Vulnerability & Risk; K:modeling; K:microbial ecology; K:competition; K:Diffusible compounds; K:Fisher's equation; K:invasive; K:Partial differential equations (PDEs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generalizing the magnitude of change in functional diversity of fragmented landscapes and its drivers is challenging because of the multiple scales at which landscape fragmentation takes place. Here we propose a multi-scale approach to determine whether fragmentation processes at the local and landscape scales are reducing functional diversity of trees in the East Usam-bara Mountains, Tanzania. We employ a structural equation modeling approach using five key plant traits (seed length, dispersal mode, shade tolerance, maximum tree height, and wood density) to better understand the functional responses of trees to fragmentation at multiple scales. Our results suggest both direct and indirect effects of forest fragmentation on tree functional richness, evenness, and divergence. A reduction in fragment area appears to exacerbate the negative effects resulting from an increased amount of edge habitat and loss of shape complexity, further reducing richness and evenness of traits related to resource acquisition and favoring tree species with fast growth. As anthropogenic disturbances affect forests around the world, we advocate to include the direct and indirect effects of forest fragmentation processes to gain a better understanding of shifts in functional diversity that can inform future management efforts.","2020-07","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:40:51","","","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; K:biodiversity; 2020; T:Ecology; 2015PF-016; K:ecosystem functions; K:plants; K:trees; 2015PF-017; Year 5 (JZ); Year 5 (NB); K:species diversity; K:Forests; K:wood","","Berthold Heinze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The strong increase in world trade in the past decades appears to have led to an increase in introductions of species transported by this pathway, and highlights the need for effective phytosanitary legislation and measures. The phytosanitary regulations in most countries are based on the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, but there are large differences in countries' approaches to managing the risk of introducing invasive alien species through international plant trade. We reviewed elements of the phytosanitary legislations of ten countries on all continents and aimed to find regulations that prevent biological invasions. We found large differences in countries' phytosanitary regulations. New Zealand and Australia have the strictest phytosanitary regulations, while Europe maintains a general authorization for P4P imports.

Animal movement data, whether derived from satellite collars, cellphone/hydrophone nets, or radiotelemetry studies, provide a range of information on movement including large-scale displacements and small-scale changes in orientation and velocity. To help contextualize such data and facilitate their interpretation, we developed a Java informatics tool, Animal Movement Visualizer v1.0. Built on the NASA World Wind v1.2 development kit, our free, downloadable software can display simultaneously the pathways of multiple animals moving against a backdrop of digital imagery of the Earth's surface, allowing researchers and managers to observe how multiple individuals move about with respect to one another in relative time. The program can accommodate datasets with irregularly timed relocations and relocation intervals that vary among individuals. The software displays the Earth's surface in a scalable way, facilitating visualization of specific landscape features. To illustrate possible uses for AMV, we provide a sample dataset for movement tracks of Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) moving across steppe habitat. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2013-05","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:40:50","","91–95","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; 2013; K:animal; K:ARGOS-GPS; K:cyber tool; K:Migration; K:Nomadism; K:Radiotelemetry; K:Satellite collar data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whereas metacommunity research mostly addresses questions on spatial biodiversity patterns at the regional scale, conservation planning requires quantifying temporal variation in those metacommunities, and the contributions that individual (local) habitats make to regional dynamics. Here we propose that recent advances in diversity partitioning methods may allow for a better understanding of metacommunity dynamics and for the identification of keystone habitats. First, we show how time series of the two components of beta diversity (richness and replacement), and of the contributions of local habitats to these components, can provide valuable insights into metacommunity dynamics. Second, we apply this framework to a time-series data set of a highly-dynamic model system (an intermittent river) to identify which habitats control source-sink dynamics. Finally, we show how overlooking the temporal component of variation in metacommunity structure may lead to underestimating beta diversity, and we discuss how conservation and metacommunity ecology research in highly-dynamic ecosystems could benefit from studying beta diversity components over time. Adequately appraising spatio-temporal variability in community composition, and identifying sites that are pivotal for maintaining biodiversity at the landscape scale, are key needs for conservation prioritization and planning. Our framework may thus guide conservation actions in highly-dynamic ecosystems whenever time-series data describing biodiversity across sites connected by dispersal are available.","2017-02","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:40:50","","1459-1468","","6","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","70 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8JE9H3FX/Ruhí et al. - 2017 - Interpreting beta-diversity components over time t.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecology; Year 6; 2016PF-025; K:metacommunity; K:dispersal; K:beta-diversity; K:source–sink dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of their efforts to support hydrodiplomacy, IRBOs engage in the production and use of science. The manner in which that science is produced, and how it contributes to hydrodiplomacy, is not well understood. This paper examines the production and use of science by three IRBOs: the (US – Canada) International Joint Commission, the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River, and the Mekong River Commission. We find the science produced by the IRBOs to support hydrodiplomacy extends beyond measuring and monitoring to include more advanced and analytical forms of science. In producing science, we observe that the IRBOs balance considerations of capacity, ownership, and how the politics of the basin will influence the production and use of the science. Given the challenge of balancing across these considerations, future research is needed to determine what mechanisms and processes for producing science can best facilitate its use in hydrodiplomacy.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:40:50","","137–149","","","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BDTERQBG/S1462901119314157.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; 2020; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:cooperation; T:Political Science; K:watersheds; K:Science policy interface; K:science-policy interface; 2016C15-006; K:Hydrodiplomacy; K:Transboundary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand deforestation and agricultural expansion in Amazonian protected areas, we combined quantitative land-use-change modeling with qualitative discourse analysis in a case study of Brazil's Jamanxim National Forest. We modeled land-use change from 2008 to 2018 and projected deforestation through 2028. We used variables identified in a review of studies that modeled land-use change in the Amazon (e.g., variables related to agricultural suitability and economic accessibility) and from a critical discourse analysis that examined documents produced by different actors (e.g., government agencies and conservation nonprofit organizations) at various spatial scales. As measured by analysis of variance, McFadden's adjusted pseudo R2, and quantity and allocation disagreement, we found that including variables in the model identified as important to deforestation dynamics through the qualitative discourse analysis (e.g., the proportion of unallocated public land, distance to proposed infrastructure developments, and density of recent fires) alongside more traditional variables (e.g., elevation, distance to roads, and protection status) improved the predictive ability of these models. Models that included discourse analysis variables and traditional variables explained up to 19.3% more of the observed variation in deforestation probability than a model that included only traditional variables and 4.1% more variation than a model with only discourse analysis variables.

However, the approaches used to understand the impacts of such strategies sometimes favor social over environmental theory, or the opposite, but do not always consider both equally. Our study addresses this disconnect by exploring the role of urban agriculture (UA) as an alleviation and land management strategy in Mexico City (MC), Mexico. Our integrated design combined the ecosystem services framework, which was primarily used to assess material and non-material benefits MC residents obtain from UA spaces and its associated vegetation, and the livelihoods framework, which was used to evaluate the relationship between UA and societal impacts. We used a mixed-method approach to quantify the amount of food produced, assess crop diversity, assess six distinct ecological processes linked to UA, identify cultural benefits, and conduct an evaluation of contributions to livelihood capitals. Our study documented the role of UA in supporting ecological processes, connecting humans to nature, and providing a supplemental source of income. However, a multitude of unintended outcomes are identified, such as tradeoffs between different ecological processes, constraints in promoting formal education beyond agroecological knowledge, and an inability to fully elevate families out of poverty. Our integrated approach demonstrated how the ecosystem services and livelihoods frameworks can be used simultaneously to provide thorough assessments of socio-ecological systems, identifying outcomes that could go unnoticed without an interdisciplinary lens.","2023-03","2023-04-14 15:30:58","2023-12-07 17:40:49","2023-04-14 15:30:58","1-62","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","journals.ametsoc.org","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Earth Interactions","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NFGQPP54/González et al. - 2023 - Integration of the Livelihood and Ecosystem Servic.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; Year 8; F:Actionable Research; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; F:Case study collection; 2023; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2018GS5-009","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated consequences of a hypothetical introduction of Newcastle disease (ND) into a wild population of Peru’s most trafficked psittacine, the white-winged parakeet (Brotogeris versicolurus), through release of infected confiscated individuals. We developed two mathematical models that describe ND transmission and the influence of illegal harvest in a homogeneous (model 1) and age-structured population of parakeets (model 2). Infection transmission dynamics and harvest were consistent for all individuals in model 1, which rendered it mathematically more tractable compared to the more complex, age-structured model 2 that separated the host population into juveniles and adults. We evaluated the interaction of ND transmission and harvest through changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) and short-term host population dynamics. Our findings demonstrated that ND introduction would likely provoke considerable disease-related mortality, up to 24% population decline in two years, but high harvest rates would dampen the magnitude of the outbreak. Model 2 produced moderate differences in disease dynamics compared to model 1 (R0 = 3.63 and 2.66, respectively), but highlighted the importance of adult disease dynamics in diminishing the epidemic potential. Therefore, we suggest that future studies should use a more realistic, age-structured model. Finally, for the presumptive risk that illegal trade of white-winged parakeets could introduce ND into wild populations, our results suggest that while high harvest rates may have a protective effect on the population by reducing virus transmission, the combined effects of high harvest and disease-induced mortality may threaten population survival. These results capture the complexity and consequences of the interaction between ND transmission and harvest in a wild parrot population and highlight the importance of preventing illegal trade.","2016-01","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:40:49","2021-11-24 14:36:06","","","1","11","","PLOS ONE","Interacting Effects of Newcastle Disease Transmission and Illegal Trade on a Wild Population of White-Winged Parakeets in Peru","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XNCNAPLE/Daut et al. - 2016 - Interacting Effects of Newcastle Disease Transmiss.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3FCRRG7G/Daut et al. - 2016 - Interacting Effects of Newcastle Disease Transmiss.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YSQTMPJ3/article.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V2UTE76A/article.html","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; Year 5; T:Ecology; 2016; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Disease & Pests; K:trade; K:Birds; K:Population dynamics; K:Epidemiology; K:epidemiology; 2015PF-021; K:disease modeling; K:illegal; K:pet trade; K:Wildlife; T:Wildlife; K:Death rates; K:Disease dynamics; K:Infectious disease epidemiology; K:Veterinary diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, submersed plant beds can also modify nutrient cycling through feedback loops whereby algal growth is limited and plant growth is enhanced. Whereas most studies on the effect of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds on nutrient cycling concentrate on either biogeochemical or physical controlling mechanisms, we use a holistic approach that analyzes how these processes interact. We measured a suite of physical and biological processes in a large SAV bed and developed a simple, 1-dimensional reactive transport model to investigate the mechanisms underlying SAV bed effects on nutrient cycling. We observed lower water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIN and DIP) inside relative to outside the SAV bed during the summer. Sediment denitrification (mean N2-N flux in August = 46 μmol m−2 h−1) and plant nutrient assimilation (August rates =385 μmol N and 25 μmol P m−2 h−1) were mechanisms of nutrient removal. We also found that the physical structure of the bed decreased advection and tidal dispersion, resulting in increased water residence time that enhanced biologically mediated nutrient loss. These processes create conditions that enable SAV to outcompete other primary producers, as water column nutrient concentrations were low enough to limit algal growth and associated light attenuation, while sediment pore water concentrations were sufficient to satisfy SAV nutrient demand. These findings suggest that interactions between physical and biological feedback processes in SAV beds can play a key role in structuring shallow aquatic ecosystems.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:40:49","","1626-1641","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer US","","","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; Year 6; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Pollution; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2016PF-024; K:algae; K:biogeochemical; K:biophysical; K:interactions; K:SAV; K:seagrass; K:submersed aquatic vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2015 two groups of octopus fishers from Bahia de los Angeles, Mexico and Sarodrano, Madagascar travelled to Andavadoaka, southwest Madagascar to learn about the temporary fishing closures for octopus used in the region. Octopus fisheries in Madagascar and Mexico differ in several respects, particularly harvesting techniques. The FLE was qualitatively evaluated through participant observation and semi-structured key informant (KI) interviews. Thirty before-and-after interviews were carried out with 16 KIs including visitors, hosts and organisers. Informants suggested that holding the FLE at the same time as the closure openings allowed for learning benefits but carried an important opportunity cost for organisers and host participants, and that shortcomings of planning and translation capacity limited learning opportunities. Several KIs were concerned about the applicability of the Malagasy management model to the Mexican context concerned, and the FLE may have had unforeseen consequences since Malagasy fishers were excited to learn a new fishing method (trapping) from the visitors: if effective, trapping could negatively impact Malagasy octopus stocks. The exchange of knowledge in the FLE was primarily one-way, from host to visitor, and most organisers did not view themselves as participants. Recommendations to improve the effectiveness of future FLEs include: (i) improving facilitation and translation capacity to promote dialogue, (ii) focusing on key messages, (iii) selecting appropriate participants and (iv) recruiting a specialist to organise and lead exchanges.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:40:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WEEFVJ26/Gardner et al. - 2017 - Intended and unintended outcomes in fisheries lear.pdf","","2017; no acknowledgment; T:Social Science; Year 1; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; Workshop; T:Fisheries; 2012W-005; K:Community; K:Knowledge exchange; K:social capital; K:Social learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate literacy programs have traditionally promoted education on the biophysical science of the climate system but have largely failed to integrate relevant knowledge from the social sciences. We argue that understanding human behavior and the social drivers of climate change are essential for the public to fully appreciate the climate system, and that this knowledge can inform decision making related to climate-change mitigation and adaptation. Teaching students to evaluate different forms of evidence will also improve climate literacy and lead them to ask how scientists know what they know.

Physical and economic data about water in many nations are becoming more widely integrated through application of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water), which enables the tracking of linkages between water and the economy. We present the first national and subnational SEEA-Water accounts for the United States. We compile accounts for water: (1) physical supply and use, (2) productivity, (3) quality, and (4) emissions for roughly the years 2000 to 2015. Total U.S. water use declined by 22% from 2000 to 2015, falling in 44 states though groundwater use increased in 21 states. Water-use reductions, combined with economic growth, led to increases in water productivity for the overall national economy (65%), mining (99%), and agriculture (68%). Surface-water quality trends were most evident at regional levels, and differed by water-quality constituent and region. This work provides (1) a baseline of recent historical water resource trends and their value in the U.S., and (2) a roadmap for the completion of future accounts for water, a critical ecosystem service. Our work also aids in the interpretation of ecosystem accounts in the context of long-term water resources trends.","2020-10","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2023-12-07 17:40:48","","101182","","","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; 2020; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 6; F:Water & People; 2016C14-003; K:Water quality; K:accounting; K:indices; K:SEEA-water; K:water accounts; K:Water use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an effort to gain an improved understanding of the practices that conservation governance regimes deploy, and their underlying rationales, I present an empirically-driven account drawn from ethnographic field work in Kenyan Ilkisongo Maasai land surrounding Amboseli National Park. I argue that to understand recent configurations of land, it is essential to consider the multiple types of interlocking practices deployed by international wildlife conservation NGOs and the Kenyan state. Under a range of pressures to subdivide collectively titled land, a new territorial and governance configuration is emerging where land tenure will retain characteristics of being both private and collective. I argue that a discursive emphasis that frames conservation interventions as producing welfare for populations of wildlife and pastoralists alike has created new potentials to center the concerns of politically marginalized pastoralists, but has also raised risks of an ‘anti-politics’ that can reproduce and reinforce multiple dimensions of power asymmetries.","2022-10","2022-10-18 17:37:18","2023-12-07 17:40:47","2022-10-18 17:37:18","102712","","","99","","Political Geography","Instrumentalizing pastoralism?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9ERM4YUE/S0962629822001263.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Human Geography; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2022; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; T:Environmental History; Year 10; T:Wildlife; 2020PF-053","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the infrastructure sufficiency in meeting water demand under climate-induced socio-hydrological transition in the Capibaribe River basin (CRB). The basin has experienced spatial and sectoral (agriculture-to-urban) reconfiguration of water demands. Human settlements that were once dispersed, relying on intermittent sources of surface water, are now larger and more spatially concentrated, which increases water-scarcity effects. Based on the application of linked hydrologic and water-resources models using precipitation and temperature projections of the IPCC SRES (Special Report: Emissions Scenarios) A1B scenario, a reduction in rainfall of 26.0% translated to streamflow reduction of 60.0%. We used simulations from four members of the HadCM3 (UK Met Office Hadley Centre) perturbed physics ensemble, in which a single model structure is used and perturbations are introduced to the physical parameterization schemes in the model (Chou et al., 2012). We considered that the change of the water availability in the basin in the future scenarios must drive the water management and the development of adaptation strategies that will manage the water demand. Several adaptive responses are considered, including water-loss reductions, wastewater collection and reuse, and rainwater collection cisterns, which together have potential to reduce future water demand by 23.0%. This study demonstrates the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure system during socio-hydrological transition in response to hydroclimatic and demand variabilities in the CRB and also indicates the differential spatial impacts and vulnerability of multiple uses of water to changes over time. The simulations showed that the measures proposed and the water from interbasin transfer project of the São Francisco River had a positive impact over the water supply in the basin, mainly for human use. Industry and irrigation will suffer impact unless other measures are implemented for demand control.","2014-09","2022-08-08 19:21:49","2023-12-07 17:40:47","2022-08-08 19:21:49","3449-3459","","9","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","hess.copernicus.org","","22 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XHXEW6YN/Ribeiro Neto et al. - 2014 - Infrastructure sufficiency in meeting water demand.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6FDNFKWP/2014.html","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; Year 2; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Modeling; 2013T5-001; F:Water & People; T:Engineering & Design; 2014; K:infrastructure development; K:water demand; K:river basins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus on disservices has been controversial because of the lack of clarity on how to disentangle ecosystem services and disservices related to human wellbeing. A perspective that considers both services and disservices is needed to inform objective decision-making. We propose a comprehensive typology of ecosystem disservices, and present a framework for integrating ecosystem services and disservices for human wellbeing linked to ecosystem functioning. Our treatment is underpinned by three key assumptions: (1) ecosystem attributes and functions are value-free; (2) the perception of benefits or nuisances are however dependent on societal context, and preferences and actions by societal actors may trigger, enhance or alleviate benefits or nuisances derived from ecosystems; and (3) the notion of disservices must account for the role of human management in assessments of ecosystem values, i.e. the social and technological measures that identify, protect, promote or restore desirable levels of services, and concurrently minimise, mitigate or adapt to disservices. We illustrate our ideas with examples from plant invasions as a complex social-ecological phenomenon.","2017-02","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2023-12-07 17:40:47","","94–107","","","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","171 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Social Science; T:Sociology; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Year 3; K:perceptions; 2013T7-006; K:invasive; K:disservices; K:valuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many places within cities offer opportunities for people to interact with wildlife, including open space and residential yards and gardens, but little is known about which places within a city people use to observe wildlife. In this study, we used publicly available spatial data on people's observations of birds from three online platforms—eBird, iNaturalist, and Flickr—to determine where people observe birds within the city of Chicago, Illinois (USA). Specifically, we investigated whether land use or neighborhood demographics explained where people observe birds. We expected that more observations would occur in open spaces, and especially conservation areas, than land uses where people tend to spend more time, but biodiversity is often lower (e.g., residential land). We also expected that more populated neighborhoods and those with higher median age and income of residents would have more bird observations recorded online. We found that bird observations occurred more often in open spaces than in residential areas, with high proportions of observations in recreation areas. In addition, a linear regression model showed that neighborhoods with higher median incomes, those with larger populations, and those located closer to Lake Michigan had more bird observations recorded online. These results have implications for conservation and environmental education efforts in Chicago and demonstrate the potential for social media and citizen science data to provide insight into urban human-wildlife interactions.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:40:47","","","","","196","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FSS78G7C/Lopez et al. - 2020 - Insights into human-wildlife interactions in citie.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; 2020; Year 7; 2017PF-032; T:Human Health & Well-Being; T:Wildlife; K:birds; K:Chicago; K:green spaces; K:iNaturalist; K:media; K:wildlife","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the links between these processes, fire is rarely incorporated dynamically into ecohydrologic models, which couple vegetation growth with water and nutrient fluxes. This omission has the potential to produce inaccurate estimates of long-term changes to carbon and water cycling in response to climate change and management. In this study, we describe a fire-effects model that is coupled to a distributed ecohydrologic model, RHESSys, and a fire-spread model, WMFire. The fire-effects model has intermediate structural complexity so as to be commensurate with the ecohydrologic model. The fire-effects model includes processes for litter and coarse woody debris consumption, processes for fire-associated vegetation mortality and consumption, and takes into account canopy structure (i.e., ladder fuels) for propagation of fire effects into a forest canopy. We evaluated the model in four Western U.S. sites representing different vegetation, climate, and fire regimes. The fire-effects model was able to replicate patterns of expected fire effects across different ecosystems and stand ages without being tuned to produce them; an emergent property of the model. Fire effects of shrubland and understory vegetation varied with surface fire intensity, by design, and fire effects in forest canopies were sensitive to parameters associated with the buildup of litter and understory ladder fuels. These findings demonstrate that the fire-effects model provides an effective tool for evaluating the post-fire changes to physical and ecological processes. Future work will project future fire regimes and improve understanding of watershed dynamics under climate change and land management via the simulation of the fire-effects model with fire spread and ecohydrology.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:40:47","","108880","","","416","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","T:Landscapes at Risk; Year 4; no acknowledgment; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Water & People; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:modeling; T:Disturbance; 2014T10-007; K:Consumption; K:Ecohydrology; K:RHESSys; K:U.S.; K:wildfire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we used long-term control plans from 25 U.S. cities to synthesize: the types of gray and green infrastructure being used by communities to address combined sewer overflows; the types of goals set; biophysical characteristics of each city; and factors associated with the governance of stormwater management. These city characteristics were then used to identify common characteristics of “green leader” cities—those that dedicated >20% of the control plan budget in green infrastructure. Five “green leader” cities were identified: Milwaukee, WI, Philadelphia, PA, Syracuse, NY, New York City, NY, and Buffalo, NY. These five cities had explicit green infrastructure goals targeting the volume of stormwater or percentage of impervious cover managed by green infrastructure. Results suggested that the management scale and complexity of the management system are less important factors than the ability to harness a “policy window” to integrate green infrastructure into control plans. Two case studies—Philadelphia, PA, and Milwaukee, WI—indicated that green leader cities have a long history of building momentum for green infrastructure through a series of phases from experimentation, demonstration, and finally—in the case of Philadelphia—a full transition in the approach used to manage CSOs.","2018-06","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:40:47","","124–133","","","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SBGRUPN9/Hopkins et al. - 2018 - Influence of governance structure on green stormwa.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; C:Case Study; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Pollution; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2014PF-013; K:Combined sewer overflow; K:Stormwater","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social climate models (SCMs) are an emerging class of models that embed human behaviour in climate models. We survey existing SCMs and make recommendations for how to integrate models of human behaviour and climate. We suggest a framework for representing human behaviour that consists of cognition, contagion and a behavioural response. Cognition represents the human processing of information around climate change; contagion represents the spread of information, beliefs and behaviour through social networks; and response is the resultant behaviour or action. This framework allows for biases, habituation and other cognitive processes that shape human perception of climate change as well as the influence of social norms, social learning and other social processes on the spread of information and factors that shape decision-making and behaviour. SCMs move beyond the inclusion of human activities in climate models to the representation of human behaviour that determines the magnitude, sign and character of these activities.

We defined human welfare benchmarks and evaluated patterns of water use with and without trade over a 25-year period to identify the influence of trade and inequality on equitability of water use. We found that trade improves mean water use and wellbeing, relative to human welfare benchmarks, suggesting that inequality is regrettable but not necessarily unjust.

Conducted with subsistence resource users in rural villages on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Northeast Siberia, we find evidence consistent with a model of indirect reciprocity and local social norms of helping the needy. When participants are allowed to develop reputations in the experiments, as is the case in most small-scale societies, we find that sharing is increasingly directed toward individuals experiencing hardship, good reputations increase aid, and the pooling of resources through voluntary sharing becomes more effective. We also find high levels of voluntary sharing without a strong commitment device; however, this form of cooperation does not increase contributions to the public good. Our results are consistent with previous experiments and theoretical models, suggesting strategic risks tied to rewards, punishments, and reputations are important. However, unlike studies that focus solely on strategic risks, we find the effects of rewards, punishments, and reputations are altered by the presence of environmental factors. Unexpected changes in resource abundance increase interdependence and may alter the costs and benefits of cooperation, relative to defection. We suggest environmental factors that increase interdependence are critically important to consider when developing and testing theories of cooperation.","2016-07","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:40:46","","","","7","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SP5C5XDK/Howe et al. - 2016 - Indirect Reciprocity, Resource Sharing, and Enviro.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P7Z86ZMK/article.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; K:behavior; T:Psychology; Year 2; Postdoc; 2016; F:Vulnerability & Risk; K:cooperation; K:Medical risk factors; K:Culture; 2012PF-001; K:Ethnography; K:Experimental economics; K:Game theory; K:Public goods","","Sabine Windmann","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After years of failed litigation, stakeholder efforts to develop water management solutions led to the establishment of the collaborative. This case study elucidates how collaborative governance efforts take shape, and how they can be more comprehensively assessed by drawing on interdisciplinary approaches from natural and social sciences.

It is therefore important to have access to credible models of water consumption, so as to ensure that water utilities can adequately supply water to meet the growing demand. Within the literature, there are a variety of models, but often these models evaluate the water consumption at aggregate scales (e.g., city or regional), thus overlooking intra-city differences. Conversely, the models that evaluate intra-city differences tend to rely heavily on one or two sources of quantitative data (e.g., climate variables or demographics), potentially missing key cultural aspects that may act as confounding factors in quantitative models. Here, we present a novel mixed-methods approach to predict intracity residential water consumption patterns by integrating climate and demographic data, and by incorporating social norm data to aid the interpretation of model results. Using Indianapolis, Indiana as a test case, we show the value in adopting a more integrative approach to modeling residential water consumption. In particular, we leverage qualitative interview data to interpret the results from a predictive model based on a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm. This integrative approach provides community-specific interpretations of model results that would otherwise not be observed by considering demographics alone. Ultimately, the results demonstrate the value and importance of such approaches when working on complex problems. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001611.

We found that leopards were adjusting their spatiotemporal activity patterns to both tigers and people, but by different mechanisms. Leopards spatially avoided tigers in 2010, but were generally active at the same times of day that tigers were. Despite pervasive human presence, people on foot and vehicles had no significant effect on leopard detection and space use, but leopard temporal activity was displaced from those periods of time with highest human activity. Temporal displacement from humans was especially pronounced outside the park, where there is a much greater prevalence of natural resource collection by local people. Continuing to evaluate the interconnections among leopards, tigers, prey, and people across different land management regimes is needed to develop robust landscape-scale conservation strategies.","2014-11","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:40:45","","149–162","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","79 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GG244PP4/Carter et al. - 2015 - Impacts of people and tigers on leopard spatiotemp.pdf","","no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; K:behavior; T:Sociology; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; Year 3; 2014; 2013PF-009; K:tigers; K:Camera traps; K:Nepal; K:Occupancy models; K:Temporal activity; K:wildlife conflict","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This tradeoff presents a risk for human nutrition in regions dependent on aquatic foods, including the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), where over 100 dams are planned or in construction. Previous models estimate significant reductions in fishery production resulting from these dams. This study estimates the number of new nutritionally insecure people (i.e., those at risk for nutritional deficiencies) associated with Mekong damming. We calculated population-level nutritional needs based on the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) for Cambodia and the entire LMB. We then estimated fish-derived nutrient supplies by integrating data on annual fishery production and fish nutrient content for a wide range of species. Finally, we synthesized available literature and modeling results on the impacts of damming on fisheries production, and estimated the consequent impact on inadequate intakes of protein, zinc, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and calcium, as well as potential vulnerability to losses of dietary iron. Hydropower development could restrict access to subsistence fish from the Mekong River Basin and lead to increased risk of nutritional deficiencies in Cambodia and the LMB. Our median estimates suggest that by 2030, relative to 2010, inadequate intakes could lead to an increased population at risk of nutritional deficiencies in the LMB by 0.21 to 2.23 million people for protein, 0.12 to 1.17 million people for zinc, 0.41 to 1.58 million people for niacin, 0.47 to 0.87 million people for thiamin, 0.70 to 2.31 million people for riboflavin, and approximately 10,000 people for calcium. This increased population at risk is additional to those currently malnourished. We then calculated that the average iron intake of many age-sex groups (constituting 58% of the population) will be below 150% of their EAR in 2030, indicating a potential risk of increased inadequate iron intake. Fish is the main source of animal source foods and critical micronutrients in the LMB. In the absence of mitigation efforts, any reductions in fishery production could increase already high levels of nutrient deficiency, creating a widespread risk of nutrition insecurity.","2019-10","2020-11-17 20:34:32","2023-12-07 17:40:45","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LHZ3E9R4/Golden et al. - 2019 - Impacts of Mainstream Hydropower Development on Fi.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 5; 2019; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:dams; 2015C12-041; K:nutrition; K:hydropower; K:Mekong; K:Micronutrient deficiencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children in developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Consequences include impaired cognitive and physical development and increased childhood morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest that forests help alleviate micronutrient deficiency by increasing dietary diversity. However, evidence is mostly based on weakly designed local case studies of limited relevance to global policies. Furthermore, impacts of forests on diet vary among communities, and understanding this variation can help target actions to enhance impact. We compile data on children's diets in over 43,000 households across 27 developing countries to examine the impacts of forests on dietary diversity. We use empirical designs that are attentive to assumptions necessary for causal interpretations and that adequately account for confounding factors that could mask or mimic the impact. We find that high exposure to forests causes children to have at least 25% greater dietary diversity compared to lack of exposure, a result comparable to the impacts of some nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs. A closer look at a subset of African countries indicates that impacts are generally higher for less developed communities, but highest with certain access to markets, roads, and education. Our results also indicate that forests could help reduce vitamin A and iron deficiencies. Our study establishes the causal relationship between forests and diet and thus strengthens the evidence for integrating forest conservation and management into nutrition interventions. Our results also suggest that providing households some access to capital can increase the impact of forest-related interventions on nutrition.","2018-08","2020-11-17 20:34:58","2023-12-07 17:40:45","","eaat2853","","8","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","57 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; T:Human Health & Well-Being; T:Food Systems; K:nutrition; 2012T1-003; K:children","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may lead to an adjustment of livelihood strategies and behavior of pastoral households, involving a change in attitudes toward livestock, pasture condition and social norms. We use an agent-based model to examine long-term social-ecological consequences and implications for system resilience of such behavioral changes (e.g., giving up a social norm). The model captures feedback between pastures, livestock and household livelihood in a common property grazing system. We systematically compare three stylized household behavioral types (traditional, maximizer and satisficer) that differ in their preferences for livestock, their compliance with social norms on pasture resting and how they are influenced by the behavior of others. Simulation results show that the traditional, norm-abiding household type maintains the pasture condition, provided that overall household numbers do not exceed a critical threshold. In contrast, a switch to a maximizer type that ignores norms may lead to long-term pasture degradation and livestock loss, pushing the system to an undesirable state. A change toward a new satisficing household type that constrains its herd size while diversifying its income sources can lead to improved pasture conditions and higher total livestock numbers, even with increased household numbers. We conclude that changes in household behavior have strong implications for long-term social-ecological system dynamics and have to be considered to assess the resilience of pastoral common property systems.","2018-06","2020-11-17 20:35:05","2023-12-07 17:40:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CA8H7MR4/Dressler et al. - 2019 - Implications of behavioral change for the resilien.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; T:Social Science; K:behavior; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; Year 3; K:livestock; 2013T7-013; K:socio-economic; K:Common property; K:Decision theory; k:livelihoods; K:Multi-agent simulation; K:pastoral; K:Social norms; K:Social-environmental model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of these investments on local food security remain unknown. While additional cropland and intensified agriculture could potentially increase crop production, preferential targeting of prime agricultural land and transitions toward export-bound crops might affect local access to nutritious foods. We test these hypotheses in a global systematic analysis of the food security implications of existing land concessions. We combine agricultural, remote sensing, and household survey data (available in 11 sub-Saharan African countries) with georeferenced information on 160 land acquisitions in 39 countries. We find that the intended changes in cultivated crop types generally imply transitions toward energy-rich, but nutrient-poor, crops that are predominantly destined for export markets. Specific impacts on food production and access vary substantially across regions. Deals likely have little effect on food security in eastern Europe and Latin America, where they predominantly occur within agricultural areas with current export-oriented crops, and where agriculture would have both expanded and intensified regardless of the land deals. This contrasts with Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where deals are associated with both an expansion and intensification (in Asia) of crop production. Deals in these regions also shift production away from local staples and coincide with a gradually decreasing dietary diversity among the surveyed households in sub-Saharan Africa. Together, these findings point to a paradox, where land deals can simultaneously increase crop production and threaten local food security.","2021-01","2021-01-25 16:26:05","2023-12-07 17:40:44","2021-01-25 16:25:54","","","4","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 33468655","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/89KBC3R6/Müller et al. - 2021 - Impact of transnational land acquisitions on local.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DYGNHCLV/Müller et al. - 2021 - Impact of transnational land acquisitions on local.pdf; ; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3CL55KZL/e2020535118.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KDQLKWJ8/e2020535118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468655; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468655","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; Year 8; 2021; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Africa; K:nutrition; K:remote sensing; K:land acquisition; 2018C18-010; K:cropland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, illicit activity is often overlooked or difficult to incorporate into causal inference models of land change. Evidence continues to build that narcotrafficking plays an important, yet often unreported, role in forest loss. This study presents a novel strategy to meet the challenge of estimating the causal effect of illicit activity in land change using consolidated news media reports to estimate the relationship between drug trafficking and accelerated forest loss in Central America. Drug trafficking organizations engage in illegal land transactions, money laundering, and territorial control that can manifest as forest conversion to agriculture or pasture land uses. Longitudinal data on 50 sub-national units over a period of 16 years (2001-2016) are used in fixed effects regressions to estimate the role of narcotrafficking in forest loss. Two narcotrafficking activity proxies were developed as explanatory variables of forest loss: i) an “official” proxy from drug seizures data within 14 sub-national units; and, ii) an “unofficial” proxy developed from georeferenced news media accounts of narcotrafficking events. The effect of narcotrafficking was systematically compared to the other well-known causes of forest loss, such as rural population growth and other conventional drivers. Both proxies indicate narcotrafficking is a statistically significant (p<0.01) contributor to forest loss in the region, particularly in Nicaragua (p<0.05, official proxy), Honduras (p<0.05, media proxy), and Guatemala (p<0.05, media proxy). Narcotrafficking variables explain an additional 5% (media proxy) and 9% (official proxy) of variance of forest loss not captured by conventional models.

The methods employed here could be used to estimate the causal effect of illicit activities in other land and environmental systems.

However, whether or not forest cover expansion or restoration can improve water provision services is still unclear and highly disputed. Purpose: The goal of this review is to provide a balanced and impartial assessment of the impacts of forest restoration and forest cover expansion on water yields as informed by the scientific literature. Potential sources of bias on the results of papers published are also examined. Data sources: English, Spanish and Portuguese peer-review articles in Agricola, CAB Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, JSTOR, Google Scholar, and SciELO. Databases were searched through 2015. Search terms: Intervention terms included forest restoration, regeneration/regrowth, forest second-growth, forestation/afforestation, and forestry. Target terms included water yield/quantity, streamflow, discharge, channel runoff, and annual flow. Study selection and eligibility criteria: Articles were pre-selected based on key words in the title, abstract or text. Eligible articles addressed relevant interventions and targets and included quantitative information. Results Most studies reported decreases in water yields following the intervention, while other hydrological benefits have been observed. However, relatively few studies focused specifically on forest restoration, especially with native species, and/or on projects done at large spatial or temporal scales. Information is especially limited for the humid tropics and subtropics. Conclusions and implications of key findings While most studies reported a decrease in water yields, meta-analyses from a sub-set of studies suggest the potential influence of temporal and/or spatial scales on the outcomes of forest cover expansion or restoration projects. Given the many other benefits of forest restoration, improving our understanding of when and why forest restoration can lead to recovery of water yields is crucial to help improve positive outcomes and prevent unintended consequences. Our study identifies the critical types of studies and associated measurements needed.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:40:44","","e0183210","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","214 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Island Press","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2017; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Water & People; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:meta-analysis; K:forestry; K:database searching; K:flooding; K:reforestation; K:restoration; K:surface water; K:water yield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The extent to which wetlands produce and emit greenhouse gases is intimately tied to the underlying microbial community. We established a linear transect spanning a hydrologic gradient on the margins adjacent to five seasonally saturated wetlands to characterize how water level, saturation duration, and frequency of wet-dry cycles influenced the soil and methane-cycling microbial community composition. We found that the soil and methane-cycling microbial community diversity and structure were strongly related to changes in water level and saturation duration but not saturation frequency. Soils that experienced inundation or saturation for more than 50% of the year harbored a soil microbial composition distinct from soils that were rarely saturated or inundated. While soils closer to the wetland basin supported a higher relative abundance of methanogens, methane-oxidizing microbes were present across the entire topographic gradient; however, the composition shifted from a primarily anaerobic to aerobic methanotroph community. Findings suggest that soil and methane cycling microorganisms are influenced by the hydrologic conditions of the soil, with methane producers being restricted to specific ranges and methane oxidizers able to occur under a variety of hydrologic conditions. The mechanisms driving methane oxidation by the latter, however, may depend on the hydrologic conditions.","2020-11","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2023-12-07 17:40:43","2020-11-23 20:12:31","","","","8","","Front.

Changing climate may continue this trajectory, but it also presents a window of opportunity for renewal of both ecosystems and institutions. Resilience provides a bridging concept that predicts that change in ecological and social systems is often dramatic, abrupt, and surprising. Adapting to the uncertainty of climate driven change must be done in a manner perceived as legitimate by the participants in a democratic society. Adaptation must begin with the current hierarchical and fragmented social ecological system as a baseline from which new approaches must be applied. Achieving a level of integration between ecological concepts and governance requires a dialogue across multiple disciplines, including ecologists with expertise in ecological resilience, hydrologists and climate experts, with social scientists and legal scholars.

Existing theories explain coexistence mainly as an effect of competitive relations and/or disturbances. However, theoretical studies on the way facilitative interactions resulting from hydraulic lift affect tree–grass coexistence and the range of environmental conditions in which savannas are stable are still lacking. We investigated the role of hydraulic lift in the stability of tree–grass coexistence in savannas. To that end, we developed a new mechanistic model that accounts for both competition for soil water in the shallow soil and fire-induced disturbance. We found that hydraulic lift favors grasses, which scavenge the water lifted by woody plants. Thus, hydraulic lift expands (at the expenses of woodlands) the range of environmental conditions in which savannas are stable. These results indicate that hydraulic lift can be an important mechanism responsible for the coexistence of woody plants and grasses in savannas. Grass facilitation by trees through the process of hydraulic lift could allow savannas to persist stably in mesic regions that would otherwise exhibit a forest cover.","2015-09","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:40:43","","1038–1051","","4","207","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","61 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MQ6NK4XE/Yu and D'Odorico - 2015 - Hydraulic lift as a determinant of tree–grass coex.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CQ28FRSH/nph.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2015; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Ecology; Fellow; T:Disturbance; K:model; K:coexistence; K:competition; K:facilitation; K:fire; K:hydraulic lift; K:savanna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored this through the USN properties of connectivity, heterogeneity, and scaling, which were quantified using outputs from a hydrological model and network dispersion mechanisms. The network properties were determined retrospectively in space and time by reconstructing the contemporary history of urban development and stormwater infrastructure in an arid, urban catchment in the City of Scottsdale, Arizona, United States. We found that the relative importance to USN functioning of both network structure (geomorphology) and dynamics (spatial celerity pattern) changed with the spatial scale, with network geomorphology being more dominant at larger spatial scales. The importance of network geomorphology suggested that the structure of the USN itself could potentially serve as a stormwater control measure, e.g., by enhancing flow dispersion. The temporal evolution of the USN revealed a sudden change in the hydrological functioning of the network, which seemed to be a consequence of the combined effects of patchy urban development and changes in network connectivity. The interactions between the urban spatial pattern, stormwater infrastructure, and surface runoff may result in threshold‐like behavior. A spatial multiscale approach to stormwater management may be beneficial to ensure that hydrological benefits at one scale do not cause unintended consequences at another. Overall, the retrospective modeling and network analysis approach used in this study may be useful for understanding emergent urban stormwater impacts.","2019-07","2020-11-17 20:30:12","2023-12-07 17:40:43","","6517–6533","","8","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZEF7KHE5/Jovanovic et al. - 2019 - Hydrological Functioning of an Evolving Urban Stormwater Network.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TPU69DWL/Jovanovic et al. - 2019 - Hydrological Functioning of an Evolving Urban Stor.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 7; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; T:Engineering & Design; K:model; 2017PF-035","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of change in diatom assemblages between historical (palaeolimnological) and modern times. Location: Ecuadorean Andes Methods: We compared historical (pre-1850) and modern (2017) diatom assemblages from 21 lakes and determined the relative role of environmental (water chemistry and climate) and spatial factors (distance-based Moran's eigenvectors maps) on both assemblages using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with environmental fitting. In addition, we used redundancy analysis (RDA) with variance partitioning to estimate the historical (measured using downcore assemblage composition) effects on modern diatom assemblages and identified diatom species that contributed most to dissimilarity between the two times. Results:  Diatom changes between the two time points were limited across the group of lakes, as indicated by the NMDS ordination. Variance partitioning indicated that modern diatom assemblages were affected by environmental and spatial effects, but with non-significant effects of past diatom species composition. Ordination results showed that variables related to elevation and water chemistry affected both modern and historical diatom assemblages. Diatom species with the best fit on NMDS axes (i.e. >70%) were influenced by elevation and climatic variables. The most distinctive change between the two time periods was the higher relative abundance of planktic diatom species in top-core assemblages of some lakes, but in a highly variable fashion across gradients of increased elevation and water depth. Main conclusions: Landscape palaeolimnological analyses of varied Ecuadorean Andean lakes demonstrate both environmental and spatial controls on diatom metacommunities. The multi-faceted ecological control of the altitudinal gradient on both historic and contemporary diatom assemblages suggests species sorting and dispersal constraints operating at centennial time-scale. Although a few individual lakes show substantive change between the 1850s and today, the majority of lakes do not, and the analysis suggests the resilience of lakes at a regional scale. We emphasize the potential of diatom palaeolimnological approaches in biogeography to test ecologically relevant hypotheses of the mechanisms driving recent limnological change in high-elevation tropical lakes.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:40:43","","1889-1900","","8","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MKLQAAUV/Benito et al. - 2019 - Identifying temporal and spatial patterns of diato.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; K:metacommunity; T:Environmental History; K:diatoms; K:Andes; K:altitudinal gradient; K:Humboldt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Driver–Pressure–State–Impact–Response (DPSIR) framework is one such approach that has been adopted in some coastal zones around the world. Although the application of the DPSIR framework has considerable potential to bridge the gap between scientific disciplines and link science to coastal policy and management, current applications of DPSIR in coastal environments have been limited and new innovations in the application of the DPSIR model are needed. We conducted a structured review of literature on the DPSIR framework as applied to the function, process and components of complex coastal systems. Our specific focus was on how the DPSIR framework has been used as a tool to organize sophisticated empirical scientific research, support transdisciplinary knowledge at a level appropriate for building understanding about coastal systems, and how adopting a DPSIR approach can help stakeholders to articulate and structure challenges in coastal systems and use the framework to support policy and management outcomes. The review revealed that DPSIR models of coastal systems have been largely used to support and develop conceptual understanding of coastal social–ecological systems and to identify drivers and pressures in the coastal realm. A limited number of studies have used DPSIR as a starting point for semi-quantitative or quantitative analyses, although our review highlights the continued need for, and potential of, transformative quantitative analyses and transdisciplinary applications of the DPSIR framework. The DPSIR models we reviewed were predominantly single sector, encompassing ecological or biophysical factors or focusing primarily on socio-cultural dimensions rather than full integration of both types of information. Only in eight of 24 shortlisted articles did researchers actively engage decision-makers or citizens in their research: given the potential opportunity for using DPSIR as a tool to successfully engage policy-makers and stakeholders, it appears that the DPSIR framework has been under-utilized in this regard.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:24","2023-12-07 17:40:42","","110–119","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","137 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H72T64EZ/Lewison et al. - 2016 - How the DPSIR framework can be used for structurin.pdf","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; 2015; T:Sustainability; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Venture; Year 3; K:policy recommendations; F:Research Frameworks; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:Complex systems analysis; K:Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS); 2013V-016; K:Coastal zone management; K:DPSIR; K:Social–ecological systems (SES)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although transmission is thought to be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, little is known about the patterns and drivers of transmission in groups of houses in endemic settings. We carried out surveys of PCR positivity in children residing in 2-block patches of highly endemic cities of Colombia. We found high levels of heterogeneity in PCR positivity, varying from less than 30% in 8 of the 10 patches to 56 and 96%, with the latter patch containing 22 children simultaneously PCR positive (PCR22) for DEN2. We then used an agent-based model to assess the likely eco-epidemiological context of this observation. Our model, simulating daily dengue dynamics over a 20 year period in a single two block patch, suggests that the observed heterogeneity most likely derived from variation in the density of susceptible people. Two aspects of human adaptive behavior were critical to determining this density: external social relationships favoring viral introduction (by susceptible residents or infectious visitors) and immigration of households from non-endemic areas. External social relationships generating frequent viral introduction constituted a particularly strong constraint on susceptible densities, thereby limiting the potential for explosive outbreaks and dampening the impact of heightened vectorial capacity. Dengue transmission can be highly explosive locally, even in neighborhoods with significant immunity in the human population. Variation among neighborhoods in the density of local social networks and rural-to-urban migration is likely to produce significant fine-scale heterogeneity in dengue dynamics, constraining or amplifying the impacts of changes in mosquito populations and cross immunity between serotypes.","2015-12","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:40:42","","e0144451","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","no acknowledgment; 2015; T:Sociology; Postdoc; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; T:Disease & Pests; K:migration; 2013PF-008; K:mosquitoes; Year 3 (ABC); 2013PF-006; K:Aedes aegypti; K:Armenia; K:birth rates; K:cities; K:dengue fever; K:dengue virus; K:neighborhoods; Year 3 (HP)","","Richard Paul","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collapses have occurred frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic, intellectual, and population decline. Many different natural and social phenomena have been invoked to explain specific collapses, but a general explanation remains elusive. In this paper, we build a human population dynamics model by adding accumulated wealth and economic inequality to a predator–prey model of humans and nature. The model structure, and simulated scenarios that offer significant implications, are explained. Four equations describe the evolution of Elites, Commoners, Nature, and Wealth. The model shows Economic Stratification or Ecological Strain can independently lead to collapse, in agreement with the historical record. The measure “Carrying Capacity” is developed and its estimation is shown to be a practical means for early detection of a collapse. Mechanisms leading to two types of collapses are discussed. The new dynamics of this model can also reproduce the irreversible collapses found in history. Collapse can be avoided, and population can reach a steady state at maximum carrying capacity if the rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a sustainable level and if resources are distributed equitably.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:40:42","","90–102","","","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","204 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RM7WKVLY/Motesharrei et al. - 2014 - Human and nature dynamics (HANDY) Modeling inequa.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Staff; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Economics; T:Sustainability; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Ecology; 2014; K:inequality; K:model; K:Carrying capacity; K:Ecological strain; K:Economic inequality; K:environmental economics; K:Human–nature dynamics; K:Overshoot vs. sustainability; K:Societal collapse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we focus on two common approaches to nexus research, quantitative modeling and futures thinking, and the ways that each set of methodological tools address uncertainty. We first review the underlying assumptions of each approach with a focus on sources of and ability to measure uncertainty, and potential complementarities. Quantitative modeling takes a probabilistic approach to predicting the likelihood of a specific outcome or future state based on estimates of current system dynamics. In contrast, futures thinking approaches, such as scenario processes, explore novel changes that cannot be fully predicted or even anticipated based on current understandings of the nexus. We then examine a set of applied nexus projects that bridge science and policy-making contexts to better understand practitioner experiences with different methodological tools and how they are utilized to navigate uncertainty. We explore one nexus case study, LIVES Cambodia, in-depth, to better understand the opportunities and challenges associated with participatory modelling and stakeholder engagement with uncertainty in a policy-making context. Across the cases, practitioners identify the complementarity between modeling and futures thinking approaches, and those projects that integrated both into the planning process experienced benefits from having multiple angles on uncertainty within the nexus. In particular, stakeholder engagement provided critical opportunities to address some types of uncertainties (e.g. data gaps) through the use of local knowledge. Explicit discussions of model uncertainty and use of scenario processes also enabled stakeholders to deepen their understandings of uncertainties and envision policy pathways that would be robust to uncertainty. In many senses, models became boundary objects that encouraged critical thinking and questioning of assumptions across diverse stakeholders. And, for some nexus projects, confronting uncertainty in explicit and transparent ways build capacity for policy flexibility and adaptiveness. We conclude with a discussion of when and how these benefits can be fully realized through the strategic use of appropriate approaches to characterizing and navigating nexus uncertainty.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:40:42","","37","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; reported to NSF; 2019; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; F:Actionable Research; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; K:scenario modeling; K:model; K:futures thinking; K:quantitative modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, analyses of current urban forest characteristics are often limited to contemporary socioeconomic factors, overlooking the role of history. The institutions, human communities, and biophysical conditions of cities change over time, creating layers of legacies on the landscape, shifting urban forests through complex interactive processes and feedbacks. Urban green spaces and planted trees can persist long after their establishment, meaning that today's mature canopy reflects conditions and decisions from many years prior. In this synthesis article, we discuss some of the major historical human and biophysical drivers and associated legacy effects expressed in present urban forest patterns, highlighting examples in the United States and Canada. The bioregional context − native biome, climate, topography, initial vegetation, and pre-urbanization land use − represents the initial conditions in which a city established and grew, and this context influences how legacy effects unfold. Human drivers of legacy effects can reflect specific historical periods: colonial histories related to the symbolism of certain species, and the urban parks and civic beautification movements. Other human drivers include phenomena that cut across time periods such as neighborhood urban form and socioeconomic change. Biophysical legacy effects include the consequences of past disturbances such as extreme weather events and pest and disease outbreaks. Urban tree professionals play a major role in many legacy effects by mediating the interactions and feedbacks between biophysical and human drivers. We emphasize the importance of historical perspectives to understand past drivers that have produced current urban forest patterns, and call for interdisciplinary and mixed methods research to unpack the mechanisms of long-term urban forest change at intra- and inter-city scales.","2018-03","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:40:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","126 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Q7X2T64W/Roman et al. - 2018 - Human and biophysical legacies shape contemporary .pdf","","2018; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Synthesis Research; Workshop; T:Ecology; K:Urban ecology; T:Environmental History; K:Historical ecology; 2015W-050; K:Legacy effect; K:Social-ecological system; K:Tree diversity; K:Urban tree canopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing number of interdisciplinary research teams investigate coupled natural-human systems, but the degree to which they actually examine two-way linkages between the systems is limited. We examined aspects of interdisciplinary teams that were explicitly funded to conduct research including such linkages by considering attributes of team leaders, team members, and analysis methods employed. Our objective was to investigate the degree to which interdisciplinary teams studying coupled natural-human systems publish research that displays two-way linkages between systems. Our analysis shows that team members’ academic disciplines and the types of analysis methods that interdisciplinary teams apply play a crucial role in the success of the team in publishing articles that include two-way linkages. We found that the success of developing two-way linkages is enhanced when teams include leaders and/or members from interdisciplinary academic disciplines (e.g., planning departments, sustainability, environmental economics, biological and ecological engineering, and individuals affiliated with more than one academic department from different discipline categories). Additionally, the presence of social science members increases the likelihood of two-way linkages, whereas the presence of physical science or biological/life science members decreases this likelihood. Among articles that included two-way linkages, essentially all utilized a conceptual-/literature-review approach, or included simulation model analysis. Based on these findings, we conclude that interdisciplinary teams are not a mere sum of people from different academic disciplines, but a group of people who have the ability to incorporate different disciplines conceptually and analytically. To move forward, it is important to acknowledge that becoming an interdisciplinary researcher takes deliberative work. Educational programs that train students and early career scholars with flexible thinking and analytical capacities may be the key to furthering coupled natural-human systems research.","2022-07","2022-07-19 14:33:30","2023-12-07 17:40:40","2022-07-19 14:33:30","","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2022 by the author(s)","","","","ecologyandsociety.org","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JKV8CCMB/Shin et al. - 2022 - How coupled is coupled human-natural systems resea.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LZPFALWZ/art4.html","","T:Social Science; Foundation; Postdoc; Year 8; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Team Science & Collaborations; F:Science of Team Science; 2022; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Building Socio-Environmental Research Teams; wrong DBI; Year 10; 2020PF-052; 2019F-012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis is based on a multi-regional input–output model, which allows us to estimate life-cycle emissions for all major household consumption items. Results demonstrate that household carbon footprints in all the Baltic States significantly increased by 47% in Estonia, 20% in Latvia and 52% in Lithuania during the study period. In 2011 in Estonia expenditures for housing and utility contributed the highest per capita life-cycle emissions – 43%. However, in Lithuania housing accounted only for 16% of per capita emissions, but food and transport were responsible for 31%; whereas in Estonia and Latvia transport accounted for 18% and 21%, respectively. Production processes related to food consumption are responsible for 18% of emissions in Estonia, 31% in Latvia and Lithuania. Most of the indirect emissions are related to imports from Russia and China followed by imports from other Baltic States. If consumption-based emissions are to decrease countries will have to (1) change household behavior, which requires relevant knowledge, infrastructure and resources to facilitate switching to lower carbon-intensive alternatives; (2) decarbonize their own energy and transport sectors; and (3) reduce lifecycle emissions associated with trade, by supporting imports from low carbon regions, including producing locally.","2016-03","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:40:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","105 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/U9GJFFBD/Brizga et al. - 2017 - Household carbon footprints in the Baltic States .pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; Venture; 2016; 2014V-027; Year 3; K:Greenhouse gas; K:model; K:CO2 emissions; K:Estonia; K:Latvia; K:Lithuania; K:Sustainable consumption; K:Trade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a survey throughout the Neotropics of the haemosporidian parasites infecting manakins (Pipridae), a family of Passerine birds endemic to this region, we asked whether host relatedness, ecological similarity and geographic proximity structure parasite turnover between manakin species and local manakin assemblages. We used molecular methods to screen 1343 individuals of 30 manakin species for the presence of parasites. We found no significant correlations between manakin parasite lineage turnover and both manakin species turnover and geographic distance. Climate differences, species turnover in the larger bird community and parasite lineage turnover in non-manakin hosts did not correlate with manakin parasite lineage turnover. We also found no evidence that manakin parasite lineage turnover among host species correlates with range overlap and genetic divergence among hosts. Our analyses indicate that host switching (turnover among host species) and dispersal (turnover among locations) of haemosporidian parasites in manakins are not constrained at this scale.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:40:40","","984-993","","7","144","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2017; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; Year 5; T:Ecology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; 2015PF-020; T:Disease & Pests; K:avian malaria; K:community assembly; K:host switching; K:host turnover; K:parasite community; K:parasite diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, policies and interventions addressing natural resource-based livelihoods have rarely considered underlying gender dynamics despite the global pervasiveness of gendered disparities in both economic opportunities and welfare outcomes. Methods/Design. Using two electronic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed academic literature describing livelihoods policies or interventions that included documentation of gendered impacts. We focused on natural resource-based livelihoods most likely to be affected by climate change, centering on interventions targeting agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and forestry. Review Results/Synthesis. We identified 131 relevant articles, most of which focus on adoption or participation in interventions rather than outcomes. In general, women are less likely than men to engage with sustainable livelihoods interventions. When women do engage, some researchers have documented income and food security gains as well as improvements in environmental indicators in the short-term. However, these initiatives have also been found to increase women's labor burden without corresponding gains in income. Few studies measure longer-term effects of women's engagement on welfare and environmental outcomes, a key gap in the literature. Additionally, relatively few studies explore the intersectional impacts of initiatives, such as the added burdens of ethnicity, class, education, or other differences that modify gender disparities. Discussion. Climate change has gendered impacts on natural resource-based livelihoods. In general, existing initiatives designed to increase livelihood resilience fail to reduce gender disparities and improve women's livelihoods. Greater attention should be paid to gender when designing sustainable livelihoods policies and interventions in order to increase adoption and participation, negotiate trade-offs, improve environmental conditions, and promote broadly beneficial welfare outcomes.","2019-07","2020-11-17 20:34:39","2023-12-07 17:40:40","","","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JNNWCKG7/Call, Sellers - 2019 - How does gendered vulnerability shape the adoption and impact of sustainable livelihood interventions in an era o.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/32PCPGQF/Call and Sellers - 2019 - How does gendered vulnerability shape the adoption.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Sociology; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Vulnerability; 2017PF-033","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, urban yards showed evidence of homogenization of composition and structure.

Our fixed-effects regression analysis reveals that the lowest predicted population growth rates occur under hot and dry conditions. The effects of heat and drought are strongest in districts that, at baseline, have high population densities, high precipitation rates, or high educational attainment. These patterns are contrary to common assumptions about these processes, and even the rare combination of hot and dry conditions, occurring in less than 7% of our sample, does not lead to local depopulation.

In this overview, the history of and foundational thinking around NEON are discussed. A framework of open science is described with a discussion of how NEON can be situated as part of a larger data constellation—across existing networks and different suites of ecological measurements and sensors. Next, a synthesis of early NEON science, based on >100 existing publications, funded proposal efforts, and emergent science at the very first NEON Science Summit (hosted by Earth Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder in October 2019) is provided. Key questions that the ecology community will address with NEON data in the next 10 yr are outlined, from understanding drivers of biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales to defining complex feedback mechanisms in human–environmental systems. Last, the essential elements needed to engage and support a diverse and inclusive NEON user community are highlighted: training resources and tools that are openly available, funding for broad community engagement initiatives, and a mechanism to share and advertise those opportunities. NEON users require both the skills to work with NEON data and the ecological or environmental science domain knowledge to understand and interpret them.

We compared likely effects of SLR for 2030 and 2050 under static inundation and dynamic response model predictions for the northeastern USA, where tidal marshes experience elevated rates of SLR compared to global averages. Static inundation and dynamic response models of SLR, which differ in how they incorporate uncertainty associated with local processes and biophysical feedbacks, have historically been applied at different scales, and generally differ in spatial and temporal predictions of marsh vulnerability. We used population estimates for five tidal marsh bird species of conservation concern to predict patterns of population change for each SLR model and examined how uncertainty affects planning decisions for these species. Static inundation and dynamic response models differed markedly in their predictions for 2030, yet both models predicted with reasonable certainty that only 10–15% of tidal marsh in northeastern USA is likely (> 66% chance; as defined by the IPCC) to remain by 2050. Most (85–90%) of the marsh is predicted to be as likely as not (33–66% chance) to disappear, representing high potential for the loss of habitat for > 85% of current populations of four of the five bird species. We propose a planning approach using guidelines established by the IPCC to categorize uncertainty associated with marsh loss due to SLR and apply it to prioritize key sites for preservation.","2021-01","2021-01-11 15:15:03","2023-12-07 17:40:39","2021-01-11 15:15:03","431-443","","","30","","Biodivers Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6ZKVFX2H/Klingbeil et al. - 2021 - High uncertainty over the future of tidal marsh bi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/D58IGIVC/Klingbeil et al. - 2021 - High uncertainty over the future of tidal marsh bi.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Ecology; 2021; K:sea level rise; K:sea-level rise; K:climate change; 2017PF-036; K:salt marsh; K:avian; K:conservation planning; K:marsh birds; K:North America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dairy and cattle production have disproportionately contributed to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use, while crop demands of more intensive systems have increased fertilizer use and competition for available crop calories. At the same time, chicken and pig production has grown more rapidly than for ruminants, indicating a change in the environmental burden per animal calorie (EBC) with time. How EBCs have changed and to what extent resource use efficiency (RUE), the composition of animal production and the trade of feed have played a role in these changes have not been examined to date. We employ a calorie-based perspective, distinguishing animal calorie production between calories produced from feedcrop sources—directly competing with humans for available calories—and those from non-feed sources—plant biomass unavailable for direct human consumption. Combining this information with data on agricultural resource use, we calculate EBCs in terms of land, GHG emissions and nitrogen. We find that EBCs have changed substantially for land (−62%), GHGs (−46%) and nitrogen (+188%). Changes in RUE (e.g., selective breeding, increased grain-feeding) have been the primary contributor to these EBC trends, but shifts in the composition of livestock production were responsible for 12%–41% of the total EBC changes. In addition, the virtual trade of land for feed has more than tripled in the past 25 years with 77% of countries currently relying on virtual land imports to support domestic livestock production. Our findings indicate that important tradeoffs have occurred as a result of livestock intensification, with more efficient land use and emission rates exchanged for greater nitrogen use and increased competition between feed and food. This study provides an integrated evaluation of livestock's impact on food security and the environment.","2015-12","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:40:39","","125013","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; 2015; T:Agriculture; Venture; Year 3; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2014V-029; K:food security; K:environmental trade-offs; K:footprint; K:livestock sector; K:virtual trade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we do not yet have a well-formed picture of the nature and extent of the human poverty of coastal communities in these areas. In this paper, we begin to fill the gap and present a multidimensional picture of the wellbeing of coastal communities, using nationally representative survey data to examine the health, wealth, and educational status of households in over 38000 communities across 38 developing countries. In general, we found high levels of poverty across the 3 dimensions (health, wealth, and education) analyzed, but each dimension also showed large heterogeneity within and across countries. We found that coastal communities had statistically significant higher levels of wellbeing than non-coastal communities. Coastal children were less stunted, less poor, and more likely to live in a higher educated household when compared to non-coastal households. However, we found that across coastal communities, rural coastal communities had 1.5 times lower height-for-age standard deviation scores (representing high childhood stunting rates), were 4 times more likely to be poor, and were 1.6 times more likely to have low levels of educational attainment. A deeper understanding of human wellbeing along coasts is critical for generating wider social and more long-term economic benefits with respect to coastal marine management.","2015-06","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:40:39","","233–242","","","530","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISBN: 0171-8630","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9UXT3UW8/Fisher et al. - 2015 - Health, wealth, and education the socioeconomic b.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; 2015; T:Education/Pedagogy; T:Conservation; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Human Health & Well-Being; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:human well-being; K:poverty; 2012T1-003; K:childhood stunting; K:coastal marine systems; K:human health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A species’ ability to disperse is expected to covary with other life-history traits to form dispersal syndromes. Dispersal might be linked to the rate of life history, fecundity, or generation time, depending on the relative selection pressures of bet-hedging, kin competition, or maintaining gene flow. However, the linkage between dispersal and plant life-history strategies remains unknown because it is difficult to observe, quantify, and manipulate the influence of dispersal over large spatiotemporal scales. We integrate datasets describing plant vital rates, dispersal and functional traits to incorporate dispersal explicitly into the rich spectra of plant life-history strategies. For 141 plant species, we estimated dispersal ability by predicting maximum dispersal distances using allometric relationships based on growth form, dispersal mode, terminal velocity and seed mass. We derived life-history traits from matrix population models parameterized with field data from the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database. We analysed the covariation in dispersal ability and life-history traits using multivariate techniques. We found that three main axes of variation described plant dispersal syndromes: the fast-slow life-history continuum, the dispersal strategy axis and the reproductive strategy axis. On the dispersal strategy axis, species’ dispersal abilities were positively correlated with aspects of fast life histories. Species with a high net reproductive rate, a long window of reproduction, low likelihood of escaping senescence and low shrinkage tendencies disperse their seeds further. The overall phylogenetic signal in our multidimensional analyses was low (Pagel's λ < 0.24), implying a high degree of taxonomic generality in our findings. Synthesis. Dispersal has been largely neglected in comparative demographic studies, despite its pivotal importance for populations. Our explicit incorporation of dispersal in a comparative life-history framework provides key insights to bridge the gap between dispersal ecology and life-history traits. Species with fast life-history strategies disperse their seeds further than slow-living plants, suggesting that longer dispersal distances may allow these species to take advantage of habitats varying unpredictably in space and time as a bet-hedging strategy.","2018-07","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:40:39","","1349–1362","","4","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","62 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/N9G7KW6X/Beckman et al. - 2018 - High dispersal ability is related to fast life-his.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FFSVVD8P/1365-2745.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; Year 5; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; 2015PF-016; K:functional trait; K:comparative demography; K:dispersal syndromes; K:fast-slow continuum; K:life-history strategy; K:life-history trait; K:matrix population model; K:phylogenetic comparative analysis","","Cyrille Violle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we evaluate an alternative approach that embraces complexity by representing the invasion as a network and using network structure to inform management locations. We compare optimal versus network-guided invasive species management at a landscape-scale, considering siting of boat decontamination stations targeting 1.6 million boater movements among 9,182 lakes in Minnesota, United States. Studying performance for 58 counties, we find that when full information is known on invasion status and boater movements, the best-performing network-guided metric achieves a median and lower-quartile performance of 100% of optimal. We also find that performance remains relatively high using different network metrics or with less information (median >80% and lower quartile >60% of optimal for most metrics) but is more variable, particularly at the lower quartile. Additionally, performance is generally stable across counties with varying lake counts, suggesting viability for large-scale invasion management.

We provide a general conceptual framework that links biodiversity and agricultural production through the separate relationships between land use and biodiversity and between land use and production. Hypothesized relationships are derived by synthesizing existing empirical and theoretical ecological knowledge. The framework suggests nonlinear relationships caused by the multifaceted impacts of land use (composition, configuration, and intensity).

We capture exporter abatement response to a set of feasible inspection policies from the regulator. Conditional on this behavioral response, we solve the regulator's problem of selecting the parameters for the state-dependent monitoring regime to minimize entry of infested shipments. We account for exporter heterogeneity, fixed penalties for noncompliance, imperfect abatement control and imperfect inspections at the border.

Non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and resource users use FLEs to share best practices and bridge knowledge gaps between small-scale fishing communities and stakeholder groups. Even though FLEs are widely used and have numerous cited benefits, there are challenges associated with planning and implementing FLEs. To overcome these challenges and maximize FLEs' effectiveness, the authors describe guidelines for FLE organizers. The guidelines are based on the perspectives of over 20 FLE experts collected during 2013 through questionnaires, interviews, discussions, and surveys. The guidelines include steps that organizers should take before, during, and after a FLE. For instance, there was broad consensus that before a FLE, it is important to select a diverse group of participants, including both conservation advocates and critics, and to create an exchange agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities of participants. During a FLE, cultural activities and daily reflections by participants are valuable to the exchange process. After a FLE, activities that formalize the participants' involvement in the FLE are important, such as welcome-home ceremonies and participation certificates. Follow-up support for FLE participants is perceived as an essential step in the FLE and should be included in the FLE's budget. Finally, challenges in organizing FLEs are explicitly described and potential solutions to overcome those challenges are provided. The authors researched and compiled these guidelines and challenges to inform and improve the increasingly widespread use of FLEs.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:40:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WEC5PIXI/Thompson et al. - 2017 - Guidelines for organizing a fisheries learning exc.pdf","","2017; no acknowledgment; Year 1; T:Conservation; Workshop; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; F:Research Frameworks; 2012W-005; K:fisheries learning exchange; K:fisheries management; K:knowledge exchange; K:marine conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite yards being ubiquitous, little comprehensive information exists on how vegetation varies between front and backyards. This hinders our ability to optimize greening interventions on private urban land. We devised an accurate GIS algorithm to locate and classify front and backyards within residential landscapes. By applying this method to the greater Boston area, we measured vegetation structure (i.e., canopy cover, height and volume) of front and backyards with LiDAR and multispectral imagery. We further investigated relationships between urban form, architectural style, socio-economics, and the structure of front and backyard vegetation across Boston's residential landscapes. Among the 85,732 residential parcels that were not corner lots and had cadastral and architectural data available, backyards were twice as large as front yards on average and had significantly greater canopy cover, vegetation volume and taller trees. Parcel-level characteristics, including vegetation in the corresponding front or backyard, as well as morphological characteristics of parcels, were the best predictors of vegetation structure. House architectural style was related to vegetation structure. The neighborhood socio-economic characteristics were the least important factors in predicting yard vegetation structure. Our study highlights that urban greening in yards depends on urban form and morphology at the parcel scale, and as such, it could be enhanced through urban to provide opportunities for additional vegetation. Architectural style might represent a further filter by which residents manage vegetation in their home environment, making it possible to devise strategies to green our cities – in style.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:30:17","2023-12-07 17:40:37","","141-157","","","185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YIM7EMSL/S0169204618312064.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 7; 2017PF-031; wrong DBI; K:residential yards; K:gis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mobility of fisheries makes them particularly dynamic and susceptible to long term drivers of movement, such as changing climatic conditions and human pressures. To explore how movement impacts resource systems, this paper presents a mixed-method empirical analysis of long-term geographic shifts and social response in the Northeast U.S. summer flounder fishery from 1996 to 2014. First, the paper describes changes in the distribution of summer flounder and the catch location of commercial fishing trips landing summer flounder. This is followed by a description of the institutional context of summer flounder fishery management and a narrative policy analysis of the ongoing regulatory process. Results indicate significant northward movement of both resource and resource users. Fisheries movement patterns are a result of both ecological change, and an institutional context that allows for some types of fishery mobility while constraining others. Significant conflict has emerged over the distribution of resource access and benefits as these fishery shifts occur within a spatially allocative, and relatively static management context. The analysis identifies competing policy narratives that have emerged to advocate for different forms of adaptation. Narratives offer contesting constructions of the nature and extent of locational shifts, and the fundamental goals of allocation. The differences in these narratives highlight how policy history shapes contemporary disagreements about appropriate response. This fishery serves as a case study for exploring human response to large scale, long-term movements of a natural resource.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:34:51","2023-12-07 17:40:37","","243–251","","","99","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MAVGIH7C/Dubik et al. - 2018 - Governing fisheries in the face of change Social responses to long-term geographic shifts in a U.S. fishery.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EDQLKKKH/Dubik et al. - 2019 - Governing fisheries in the face of change Social .pdf","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; T:Climate Change; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Fisheries; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Fisheries; 2014T9-010; K:Climate change; K:Natural resource management; K:Policy narratives; K:Social-ecological systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We unpack the micro-level economic processes by which a de facto land grab in eastern Honduras' Moskitia region was catalyzed and accelerated by the region's ascendance as a global hub of cocaine transit (ca. 2008–2012). We show how 'narco-brokers' mobilized a long-standing economic infrastructure to harness land and labor in the service of moving drugs, and how these 'mid-stream' activities captured millions of dollars from the cocaine commodity chain. We detail the processes by which those dollars ultimately concentrated land among in situ and ex situ elites by profoundly distorting social relations around land governance, labor, food production, and—ultimately—land ownership. The result was widespread dispossession, land and resource privatization, increased food insecurity, community conflict, and increased social stratification. Lands transferred from resident smallholders to elites helped to (a) integrate the region horizontally into Honduras' rentier-based cattle economy, and (b) improve the vertical integration of the pan-hemispheric cocaine trade through the speculation and profit- laundering services that the region's enclosure provided. This case highlights how economic coercions work synergistically with the more well-studied role of overt physical violence in frontier land grabs. We urge greater attention to the role of illicit capital in agrarian transformation globally. The study also points to the potential for transit spaces to shed much light on the workings of (illicit) global commodity chains and illicit economic geographies more broadly.","2018-10","2020-11-17 20:35:05","2023-12-07 17:40:37","","122–132","","","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BNJQYMSH/McSweeney et al. - 2018 - Grounding traffic The cocaine commodity chain and.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Human Geography; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Year 5; 2015C12-030; K:agrarian change; K:cocaine; K:global commodity chain; K:honduras; K:Illicit geographies; K:land grabbing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, few experimental investigations have examined effects of GCDs on plant community structure across multiple ecosystem types, and those that do exist present conflicting patterns. In an unprecedented global synthesis of over 100 experiments that manipulated factors linked to GCDs, we show that herbaceous plant community responses depend on experimental manipulation length and number of factors manipulated. We found that plant communities are fairly resistant to experimentally manipulated GCDs in the short term (<10 y). In contrast, long-term (≥10 y) experiments show increasing community divergence of treatments from control conditions. Surprisingly, these community responses occurred with similar frequency across the GCD types manipulated in our database. However, community responses were more common when 3 or more GCDs were simultaneously manipulated, suggesting the emergence of additive or synergistic effects of multiple drivers, particularly over long time periods. In half of the cases, GCD manipulations caused a difference in community composition without a corresponding species richness difference, indicating that species reordering or replacement is an important mechanism of community responses to GCDs and should be given greater consideration when examining consequences of GCDs for the biodiversity–ecosystem function relationship. Human activities are currently driving unparalleled global changes worldwide. Our analyses provide the most comprehensive evidence to date that these human activities may have widespread impacts on plant community composition globally, which will increase in frequency over time and be greater in areas where communities face multiple GCDs simultaneously.","2019-09","2020-11-22 20:53:38","2023-12-07 17:40:36","2020-11-22 20:53:38","17867-17873","","36","116","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","128 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 31427510","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/344KVP64/Komatsu et al. - 2019 - Global change effects on plant communities are mag.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NFHFHRAC/Komatsu et al. - 2019 - Global change effects on plant communities are mag.pdf; ; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TXE8NPCQ/17867.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/C52T3SAY/17867.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427510; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427510","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; T:Disturbance; 2015PF-018; K:community composition; K:species richness; K:global change experiments; K:herbaceous plants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vulnerability represents the failure of an urban supply-basin to simultaneously meet demands from human, environmental and agricultural users. We assess a baseline (2010) condition and a future scenario (2040) that considers increased demand from urban population growth and projected agricultural demand. We do not account for climate change, which can potentially exacerbate or reduce urban supply vulnerability. In 2010, 35% of large cities are vulnerable as they compete with agricultural users. By 2040, without additional measures 45% of cities are vulnerable due to increased agricultural and urban demands. Of the vulnerable cities in 2040, the majority are river-supplied with mean flows so low (1200 liters per person per day, l/p/d) that the cities experience ‘chronic water scarcity' (1370 l/p/d). Reservoirs supply the majority of cities facing individual future threats, revealing that constructed storage potentially provides tenuous water security. In 2040, of the 32 vulnerable cities, 14 would reduce their vulnerability via reallocating water by reducing environmental flows, and 16 would similarly benefit by transferring water from irrigated agriculture. Approximately half remain vulnerable under either potential remedy.","2014-10","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:40:36","","104004","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LVG43HUV/Padowski and Gorelick - 2014 - Corrigendum Global analysis of urban surface wate.pdf","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; T:Climate Change; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; T:Vulnerability; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2014; K:water security; K:scenario modeling; 2012T1-005; K:water resource management; K:water supply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, the location and productivity potential of economically water scarce croplands remain unknown.

Although previous estimates assume linear scaling between host and virus diversity, we show that ecological network theory predicts a non-linear relationship, produced by patterns of host sharing among virus species. To account for host sharing, we fit a power law scaling relationship for host–virus species interaction networks. We estimate that there are about 40,000 virus species in mammals (including ∼10,000 viruses with zoonotic potential), a reduction of two orders of magnitude from present projections of viral diversity. We expect that the increasing availability of host–virus association data will improve the precision of these estimates and their use in the sampling and surveillance of pathogens with pandemic potential.

Most fertilizer P used in the global agricultural system comes from mining of nonrenewable phosphate rock deposits located within few countries. However, P contained in livestock manure or urban wastes represents a recyclable source of P. To inform development of P recycling technologies and policies, we examined subnational, national, and global spatial patterns for two intersections of land use affording high P recycling potential: (a) manure-rich cultivated areas and (b) populous cultivated areas. In turn, we examined overlap between P recycling potential and nation-level P fertilizer import dependency. Populous cultivated areas were less abundant globally than manure-rich cultivated areas, reflecting greater segregation between crops and people compared to crops and livestock, especially in the Americas. Based on a global hexagonal grid (290-km2 grid cell area), disproportionately large shares of subnational “hot spots” for P recycling potential occurred in India, China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa. Outside of China, most of the remaining manure-rich or populous cultivated areas occurred within nations that had relatively high imports of P fertilizer (net P import:consumption ratios ≥0.4) or substantial increases in fertilizer demand between the 2000s (2002–2006) and 2010s (2010–2014). Manure-rich cultivated grid cells (those above the 75th percentiles for both manure and cropland extent) represented 12% of the global grid after excluding cropless cells. Annually, the global sum of animal manure P was at least 5 times that contained in human excreta, and among cultivated cells the ratio was frequently higher (median = 8.9). The abundance of potential P recycling hot spots within nations that have depended on fertilizer imports or experienced rising fertilizer demand could prove useful for developing local P sources and maintaining agricultural independence.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:40:36","","2018EF001097","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","58 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4PMCNRYF/Powers et al. - 2019 - Global Opportunities to Increase Agricultural Inde.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YH879E4Q/2018EF001097.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; T:Agriculture; Year 5; T:Natural Resource Management; Workshop; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:trade; K:phosphorus; 2015W-052; K:fertilizer; K:manure; K:phosphate; K:waste","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although geolocated social media (GSM) indicators have been used to examine park visitation rates, studies applying this approach are generally limited to flagship parks, national parks, or a small subset of urban parks. Here, we use geolocated Flickr and Twitter data to explore variation in use across New York City's 2143 diverse parks and model visitation based on spatially-explicit park characteristics and facilities, neighborhood-level accessibility features and neighborhood-level demographics. Findings indicate that social media activity in parks is positively correlated with proximity to public transportation and bike routes, as well as particular park characteristics such as water bodies, athletic facilities, and impervious surfaces, but negatively associated with green space and increased proportion of minority ethnicity and minority race in neighborhoods in which parks are located. Contrary to previous studies which describe park visitation as a form of nature-based recreation, our findings indicate that the kinds of green spaces present in many parks may not motivate visitation. From a social equity perspective, our findings may imply that parks in high-minority neighborhoods are not as accessible, do not accommodate as many visitors, and/or are of lower quality than those in low-minority neighborhoods. These implications are consistent with previous studies showing that minority populations disproportionately experience barriers to park access. In applying GSM data to questions of park access, we demonstrate a rapid, big data approach for providing information crucial for park management in a way that is less resource-intensive than field surveys.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:40:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","181 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZU4L5RAV/Hamstead et al. - 2018 - Geolocated social media as a rapid indicator of pa.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2014T10-020; K:Big data; K:Equity planning; K:Geolocated social media; K:Park accessibility; K:Urban parks; K:Visitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corporate zero-deforestation supply chain commitments (ZDCs) have the potential to address this deforestation, especially if strong state-led forest governance is absent. Yet, because ZDC adoption is limited to particular locations and supply chains, these commitments may fall short at reducing regional deforestation and protecting biodiverse ecosystems. Here, we leverage timeseries of spatially explicit corporate commodity sourcing data and ZDCs to assess the current and potential effect of ZDCs within soybean supply chains on forest loss and biodiversity. We focus on the Brazilian Amazon, where the first ZDC (soy moratorium (SoyM)) was implemented, and the Cerrado, where companies have adopted but not implemented ZDCs. We found that in the Amazon, SoyM signatories that controlled the market caused a 57% reduction in direct deforestation for soy from 2006 to 2015. In the Cerrado, if companies had implemented their ZDCs with the same relative effectiveness as in the Amazon, deforestation for soy could have been reduced by 46%. Thus, ZDC implementation in the Cerrado via stringent monitoring and enforcement could contribute substantially to forest and habitat conservation. Yet, incomplete ZDC adoption leaves >50% of soy-suitable forests and the biodiversity that they harbor outside the reach of ZDCs. To protect these forests, it is vital to incentivize more companies—including smaller, less publicly exposed traders—to make and implement ZDCs, while also promoting forest governance through public policy.","2022-10","2022-11-02 16:12:31","2023-12-07 17:40:35","2022-11-02 16:12:31","114003","","11","17","","Environ.

Using Drosophila melanogaster infected with Drosophila C virus as a model system, we integrated experimental measurements of social aggregation, virus shedding, and disease-induced mortality from different genetic lines and sexes into a disease modelling framework. The experimentally measured host heterogeneity produced substantial differences in simulated disease outbreaks, providing evidence for genetic and sex-specific effects on disease dynamics at a population level. While this was true for homogeneous populations of single sex/genetic line, the genetic background or sex of the index case did not alter outbreak dynamics in simulated, heterogeneous populations. Finally, to explore the relative effects of social aggregation, viral shedding and mortality, we compared simulations where we allowed these traits to vary, as measured experimentally, to simulations where we constrained variation in these traits to the population mean. In this context, variation in infectiousness, followed by social aggregation, was the most influential component of transmission.

We present a general framework for modelling subsistence and health of the rural poor by coupling simple dynamic models of population ecology with those for economic growth. The models show that feed-backs between the biological and economic systems can lead to a state of persistent poverty. Analyses of a wide range of specific systems under alternative assumptions show the existence of three possible regimes corresponding to a globally stable development equilibrium, a globally stable poverty equilibrium and bistability. Bistability consistently emerges as a property of generalized disease–economic systems for about a fifth of the feasible parameter space. The overall proportion of parameters leading to poverty is larger than that resulting in healthy/wealthy development. All the systems are found to be most sensitive to human disease parameters. The framework highlights feedbacks, processes, and parameters that are important to measure in studies of rural poverty to identify effective pathways towards sustainable development.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:40:35","","1153–1159","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2YC8CVRZ/Ngonghala et al. - 2017 - General ecological models for human subsistence, h.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318116617_General_ecological_models_for_human_subsistence_health_and_poverty_Nature_Ecology_Evolution","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Year 2; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecology; Venture; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2012V-009; K:Disease ecology; K:natural capital; K:sustainable development; K:poverty; K:poverty trap; K:rural poverty; K:socio-ecological model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location: Global.  Methods: We examined the London Natural History Museum's collection of helminth parasite occurrence records, consisting of over 18,000 unique host species and 27,000 unique helminth parasite species distributed across over 350 distinct terrestrial and aquatic localities. Results: We find support for latitudinal gradients in parasite diversity and a strong relationship between host and parasite diversity at the global scale. Helminth species diversity–area relationships were not detectable as a function of host body mass, but larger geographic areas supported higher parasite richness, potentially mediated through higher host richness.  Main conclusions: Our findings indicate that helminth parasites may obey some of the macroecological relationships found in free‐living species, suggesting that parasites may offer further support for the generality of these patterns, while offering interesting counterexamples for others.

Transitions are caused by social and/or astronomical and biogeophysical events such as volcanoes, changes in solar emissions, climate change such as sea-level/ice volume conditions, biogeochemical and ecological changes, and major social and technical innovations. We present a global-scale cultural chronology that accounts for major changes generated by such events in the late Pleistocene and Holocene. These changes are governed by transitions that make energy more or less available to human groups. The chronology is followed by methodologies to incorporate the innate, Malthusian–Darwinian human tendency to grow systems over time into a helical-feedback equation that provides for testing the hypothesis. A proof of concept test of these ideas using information system-based data from the Maya lowlands in conjunction with other civilizations suggests a troubled transition for the current worldwide economic system because of potentially catastrophic climate impacts and resource constraints on biogeophysical-social resilience in the face of obvious needs of the system to change to a more sustainable mode of acquiring energy. The Maya case implies that change is more likely to transpire because of planetary-scale disturbances/constraints in the Earth (human and planetary) system and will likely lead to strong social disruptions. There may be as many as 200 such case studies to test this idea worldwide. Our analysis suggests that a transition toward sustainability for the current energy dense globalized industrial society will be very difficult.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:30:01","2023-12-07 17:40:35","","10","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer International Publishing","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; no acknowledgment; Foundation; T:Climate Change; T:Sustainability; 2019; Year 7; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:global change; T:Environmental History; K:Holocene; 2018F-011; K:catastrophic shifts; K:Maya lowlands; K:planetary history","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecosystem services are the benefits humans derive from nature, which, until relatively recently, were not normally valued by traditional economics or, when acknowledged, were regarded as externalities. Through the identification of economic and cultural benefits of ecosystems, higher standards for landscape performance can be established. As our climate continues to change, the number of natural disasters increases, frequently with catastrophic consequences for human settlements. Designers and planners must learn how to develop adaptive strategies to climate change and mitigation strategies for the consequences that result. Most cities include underused, degraded places that are ripe for creative redevelopment. Urban ecology provides a conceptual framework that recognizes the restorative potential of people. However, although knowledge about our environments abounds, we seem limited in our ability to adopt measures necessary to ensure a healthy planet for future generations.

In the future, global biodiversity will be affected by both climate change and land-use change, the latter of which is currently the primary driver of species extinctions. How societies address climate change will critically affect biodiversity because climate-change mitigation policies will reduce direct climate-change impacts; however, these policies will influence land-use decisions, which could have negative impacts on habitat for a substantial number of species. We assessed the potential impact future climate policy could have on the loss of habitable area in biodiversity hotspots due to associated land-use changes. We estimated past extinctions from historical land-use changes (1500–2005) based on the global gridded land-use data used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report and habitat extent and species data for each hotspot. We then estimated potential extinctions due to future land-use changes under alternative climate-change scenarios (2005–2100). Future land-use changes are projected to reduce natural vegetative cover by 26-58% in the hotspots. As a consequence, the number of additional species extinctions, relative to those already incurred between 1500 and 2005, due to land-use change by 2100 across all hotspots ranged from about 220 to 21000 (0.2% to 16%), depending on the climate-change mitigation scenario and biological factors such as the slope of the species–area relationship and the contribution of wood harvest to extinctions. These estimates of potential future extinctions were driven by land-use change only and likely would have been higher if the direct effects of climate change had been considered. Future extinctions could potentially be reduced by incorporating habitat preservation into scenario development to reduce projected future land-use changes in hotspots or by lessening the impact of future land-use activities on biodiversity within hotspots.","2015-08","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:40:34","","1122–1131","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","133 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KA4TWBM4/Jantz et al. - 2015 - Future habitat loss and extinctions driven by land.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XEZD5C4Y/cobi.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; Pursuit; Year 1; 2015; T:Climate Change; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; T:Disturbance; K:land use change; K:species–area relationship; 2012T3-008; K:climate change mitigation; K:integrated assessment model; K:IPCC; K:predictive modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we combine data on morphological and ecological traits for 523 species of passerine birds distributed across an Andes-to-Amazon elevation gradient. We show that morphological traits capture substantial variation in species dietary (75%) and foraging niches (60%) when multiple independent trait dimensions are considered. Having established these relationships, we show that the 14-fold increase in species richness towards the lowlands is associated with both an increased volume and density of functional trait space. However, we find that increases in volume contribute little to changes in richness, with most (78%) lowland species occurring within the range of trait space occupied at high elevations. Taken together, our results suggest that high species richness is mainly associated with a denser occupation of functional trait space, implying an increased specialization or overlap of ecological niches, and supporting the view that niche packing is the dominant trend underlying gradients of increasing biodiversity towards the lowland tropics.","2016-01","2020-11-17 20:35:21","2023-12-07 17:40:34","","","","1822","283","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","177 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VXSDB7K5/Pigot et al. - 2016 - Functional traits reveal the expansion and packing.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Ecology; 2016; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2015PF-020; K:functional traits; K:species richness; K:ecological guild; K:elevation gradient; K:morphospace; K:niche packing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An effective course of action to reduce the spread of invasive plant species is to identify potential habitat incorporating changing climate scenarios. In this study, we used a suite of species distribution models (SDMs) to project habitat suitability of the eleven most abundant invasive weed species across road networks of Montana, USA, under current (2005) conditions and future (2040) projected climates. We found high agreement between different model predictions for most species. Among the environmental predictors, February minimum temperature, monthly precipitation, solar radiation, and December vapor pressure deficit accounted for the most variation in projecting habitat suitability for most of the invasive weed species. The model projected that habitat suitability along roadsides would expand for seven species ranging from + 5 to + 647% and decline for four species ranging from − 11 to − 88% under high representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectory. When compared with current distribution, the ensemble model projected the highest expansion habitat suitability with six-fold increase for St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), whereas habitat suitability of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) was reduced by − 88%. Our study highlights the roadside areas that are currently most invaded by our eleven target species across 55 counties of Montana, and how this will change with climate. We conclude that the projected range shift of invasive weeds challenges the status quo, and requires greater investment in detection and monitoring to prevent expansion. Though our study focuses across road networks of a specific region, we expect our approach will be globally applicable as the predictions reflect fundamental ecological processes.","2020-06","2020-11-17 20:30:02","2023-12-07 17:40:34","","60","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JQ3FKRYW/Adhikari et al. - 2020 - Future distribution of invasive weed species acros.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Natural Resource Management; 2020; T:Ecology; K:species distribution models; K:invasion biology; K:plant ecology; K:Range shifts; K:roads","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, tightly coupled interactions between aboveground and belowground organisms may buffer ecosystems to global change. Here, we test how four years of organic and inorganic N addition and removal of a dominant plant species, Festuca thurberi, independently and interactively influences fungal colonization patterns and performance in a co-dominant plant species, Helianthella quinquenervis. Surprisingly, we found N addition and Festuca removal had no measurable effects on the colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) or the performance of Helianthella seedlings grown with field-collected inoculum in a companion greenhouse experiment. However, the proximity of Helianthella to Festuca predicted fungal colonization: DSE colonization decreased by 1% for each cm of distance Helianthella was from Festuca, although the differences in fungal inoculum potential had no effect on Helianthella seedling survival or bio-mass. Our results suggest that plant-fungal interactions can be resistant to N addition and resilient to the loss of dominant plant species. Additionally, our results suggest that soil legacies, mediated through surviving symbiont communities or changes in soil properties, can shape ecosystem resistance and resilience to disturbance and perturbations.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:40:34","","","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JME9YKED/Henning et al. - 2019 - Fungal colonization of plant roots is resistant to.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2Q6HR96B/ecs2.html","","T:Resilience; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; Year 8; T:Ecology; F:Water & People; K:global change; T:Disturbance; 2018PF-041; K:arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; K:dark septate endophytes; K:Festuca thurberi; K:fungal colonization; K:Helianthella quinquenervis; K:Nitrogen deposition; K:plant–plant interactions; K:plant–soil interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite growing interest in CDR and SRM, scenarios focused on these potential responses to climate change tend to exclude feedbacks between social and climate systems (a criticism applicable to climate change scenarios more generally). We adapted the Manoa Mash-Up method to generate scenarios for CDR and SRM that were more integrative, creative, and dynamic. The method was modified to identify important branching points in which different choices in how to respond to climate change (feedbacks between climate and social dynamics) lead to a plurality of climate futures. An interdisciplinary group of participants imagined distant futures in which SRM or CDR develop into a major social-environmental force. Groups received other ""seeds"" of change, such as Universal Basic Income or China's Belt and Road Initiative, and surprises, such as permafrost collapse that grew to influence the course of events to 2100. Groups developed narratives describing pathways to the future and identified bifurcation points to generate families of branching scenarios. Four climate-social dynamics were identified: motivation to mitigate, moral hazard, social unrest, and trust in institutions. These dynamics could orient toward better or worse outcomes with SRM and CDR deployment (and mitigation and adaptation responses more generally) but are typically excluded from existing climate change scenarios. The importance of these dynamics could be tested through the inclusion of social-environmental feedbacks into integrated assessment models (IAM) exploring climate futures. We offer a step-by-step guide to the modified Manoa Mash-up method to generate more integrative, creative, and dynamic scenarios; reflect on broader implications of using this method for generating more dynamic scenarios for climate change research and policy; and provide examples of using the scenarios in climate policy communication, including a choose-your-own adventure game called Survive the Century (https://survivethecentury.net/), which was played by over 15,000 people in the first 2 weeks of launching.","2021-11","2021-12-21 17:05:35","2023-12-07 17:40:33","2021-12-21 17:05:35","","","4","26","","","From fAIrplay to climate wars","","","","","","","en","© 2021 by the author(s)","","","","www.ecologyandsociety.org","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6JA4GXQ8/Pereira et al. - 2021 - From fAIrplay to climate wars making climate chan.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YKKQQ3LV/art30.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; T:Sustainability; reported to NSF; T:Education/Pedagogy; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; F:Actionable Research; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2021; T:Disturbance; 2018C18-017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review recent research on diversity–disease relationships and identify future priorities. Growing evidence from experimental, observational and modelling studies indicates that biodiversity changes alter infection for a range of pathogens and through diverse mechanisms. Drawing upon lessons from the community ecology of free-living organisms, we illustrate how recent advances from biodiversity research generally can provide necessary theoretical foundations, inform experimental designs, and guide future research at the interface between infectious disease risk and changing ecological communities. Dilution effects are expected when ecological communities are nested and interactions between the pathogen and the most competent host group(s) persist or increase as biodiversity declines. To move beyond polarising debates about the generality of diversity effects and develop a predictive framework, we emphasise the need to identify how the effects of diversity vary with temporal and spatial scale, to explore how realistic patterns of community assembly affect transmission, and to use experimental studies to consider mechanisms beyond simple changes in host richness, including shifts in trophic structure, functional diversity and symbiont composition.","2015-10","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:40:33","","1119–1133","","10","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","186 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DURW8GEB/Johnson et al. - 2015 - Frontiers in research on biodiversity and disease.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7A9YSCBW/ele.html","","no acknowledgment; Year 1; 2015; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Venture; K:community ecology; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:biodiversity loss; K:amplification effect; K:dilution effect; K:disease ecology; 2012V-006; K:biodiversity–ecosystem function; K:symbiont","","Eric Seabloom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, we led a series of town hall events at multiple scientific-society meetings over a two-year period followed by a workshop with a diverse set of ecosystem scientists to review and expand on those outcomes. For the society town hall events ∼70 individuals were asked to give short, provocative (the so-called, soapbox) presentations and audience members (∼250) filled out tailored surveys. Both presentations and surveys were transcribed and themes were extracted and analyzed before and during the follow-up workshop. Formal ethnographic analysis of the soapbox texts produced three major themes: “frontiers,” “capacity building,” and “barriers to implementation,” including several subthemes. A workshop was held to analyze the ethnographic data where workshop participants further grouped key frontiers as (1) rethinking the drivers of ecosystem change, (2) new insights into ecosystem process and function, (3) evaluating human dimensions of ecosystem ecology, and (4) new angles on problem-solving/applied research. In addition, 13 experts were interviewed to crosscheck interpretations. The survey data, workshop deliberations, and expert interviews suggest that the core of these frontiers defines the current state and provides the foundational knowledge that bounds ecosystem ecology as a discipline. In response to emerging complex environmental issues and ongoing socioecological challenges, the edges of these frontiers expand fundamental ecosystem ecology to engage and intersect with disciplinary realms to create new ways of making sense of complexity, and to develop an even more holistic understanding of ecological systems. In this paper, we present our synthesis of the frontier and core research themes with the goal of inspiring the next wave of studies in ecosystem ecology.","2016-08","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:40:33","","753–770","","5","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer US","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9IJTZEK2/Weathers et al. - 2016 - Frontiers in Ecosystem Ecology from a Community Pe.pdf","","no acknowledgment; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Team Science & Collaborations; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2016; K:networks; K:drivers of change; K:ecological systems; K:ecosystem ecology; K:human dimensions; K:state changes; K:thresholds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increases in upland basal area and associated forest evapotranspiration reduced wetland inundation depth and duration. Wetland global warming potential decreased with higher upland basal area, driven by lower methane production in drier wetlands. Amphibian habitat suitability decreased with increasing basal area due to reduced wetland inundation. Simulations of three common 25-year management scenarios – namely, constant basal area, fire management, and pine plantation – highlighted impacts of forest structure that vary over time. Prescribed fires that recurred every 3 years generated cyclic patterns in wetland hydrology and function, whereas pine plantations transitioned from wet to dry regimes with stand growth.

In this paper, this shift is hypothesized to result from changing human values and preferences, and a power differential between the more numerous and affluent upstream urban residents (who prioritize wetland restoration) and downstream rural residents (who prioritize flood protection). We develop a conceptual sociohydrologic model to simulate the interactions between community interests and hydrology. The modeling results show that flood intensity decreased after channelization, which reduced concern about flooding. However, channelization also led to a decrease in wetland storage, which caused an increase of wetland concern, especially among the urban residents. Eventually, the community sensitivity switched from favoring flood protection to favoring wetlands, and subsequent management strategies switched from channelization to restoration. Using the model, we project that the wetlands will be recovering for the next 20 years and community sensitivity will slowly go back to a neutral state. However, possible rainfall intensification in the future could return the community sensitivity to favoring flood protection again. The preferential increase of upstream population growth will raise the community's concern about wetlands and the preferential increase of downstream population growth will magnify concern about flooding. This study provides insight into the driving forces behind human-water interactions in the Kissimmee River Basin while simultaneously demonstrating the potential of sociohydrologic modeling to describe complex human-water coupled systems with simple concepts and equations.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2023-12-07 17:40:32","","1227–1244","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IVLWLE7M/Chen et al. - 2016 - From channelization to restoration Sociohydrologi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P6RDFVX6/2015WR018194.html","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; Year 2; T:Conservation; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2013T5-001; 2016; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:modeling; K:flooding; K:human values; K:power dynamics; K:sociohydrology; K:wetland restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently there has been interest in shifting to the restoration of ecosystem services - the benefits that natural systems can provide to humans. This shift is resulting in new restoration goals as well as new methodological approaches. The pace at which restoration goals and methods are changing is particularly fast for running-water ecosystems, which calls for a rigorous assessment of the environmental and economic costs and benefits associated with such changes. In this paper, we explore the environmental costs and benefits of an emerging form of urban stream restoration, in which ecosystems are vastly transformed in order to enhance specific ecosystem functions and support desirable services. These projects are usually implemented in highly incised low-order perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream reaches. In either case, the stream channel is transformed into a stormwater management structure designed to reduce peak flows and enhance hydraulic retention of stream flow with the goals of reducing bank erosion and promoting retention of nutrients and suspended sediments. Results to date indicate that this novel ecological design approach does modify the hydrologic responses of streams during some storm events, but there is no consistent pattern of nitrogen retention or removal that would lead to net annual benefits. While additional data are needed, results suggest there is the potential for sediment retention, at least during some flows. Ongoing work which includes monitoring both pre- and post-project implementation will help resolve this uncertainty. If sediment retention does occur, it is likely to decrease over time making the lifespan of these highly engineered projects is finite. Furthermore, environmental impacts associated with these projects can include loss or damage of riparian forests and export of sediment pulses during construction which may offset project benefits depending on their lifespan. Therefore, the use of approaches where entire existing ecosystems are modified to enhance a few specific biophysical processes should be limited to the most degraded systems where less invasive techniques, such as upland reforestation, reduced lawn fertilization, or better stormwater management at the source of runoff generation have first been exhausted. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated how forest cover varies with housing density, housing age, and household income over a range of development intensities, in six ecoregions within New York State, Wisconsin, and Colorado. We find areas with residential development do retain important forest resources: across landscapes they are typically more forested than areas that remain undeveloped. However, forest cover consistently had a negative, inverse relationship with housing density, across study areas. Relationships between forest cover and housing age and household income were less common and often restricted to only portions of a given region, according to geographically weighted regression analyses. A better understanding of how forest cover varies with residential development, outside of the typically studied urban areas, will be essential to maintaining ecosystem function and services in residential landscapes.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:30:17","2023-12-07 17:40:32","","464–475","","","234","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Academic Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IWRSVELF/Mockrin et al. - 2019 - Forests, houses, or both Relationships between land cover, housing characteristics, and resident socioeconomic s.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MWHVBI8V/S0301479718314105.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2017PF-031; wrong DBI; K:Forest; K:Housing; K:Land cover; K:Residential development; K:Sprawl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, some have argued that continuing ecosystem change could undermine successes in global health investments. Here we conduct an empirical study to investigate this concern. Child deaths due to diarrhea have more than halved since the year 2000, partly due to increased access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We examine how the effectiveness of a water quality treatment may vary as a function of upstream watershed condition. We use data on occurrence of diarrhea and point-of-use water treatment methods from the Demographic and Health Surveys for Haiti and Honduras. We integrate these data with a variable that reflects the influence of upstream tree cover on surface water quality. Point-of-use chlorination is significantly associated with 3.4 percentage points reduction in prevalence of diarrheal disease on average. However, we only detect a significant reduction in diarrheal prevalence when upstream watersheds are moderately forested. At low upstream tree coverage, point-of-use water chlorination does not have significant effects, suggesting that forest clearing could undermine its effectiveness at reducing childhood diarrhea. Our results suggest that forested watersheds may reduce water-borne sediments and contaminants, and thus improve raw water quality in ways that moderate the effectiveness of water quality treatment. Watershed protection should be considered in WASH investments, as deforested watersheds could undermine their effectiveness, particularly in parts of low-income countries where access to improved WASH services is challenging.","2021-05","2021-05-27 16:25:38","2023-12-07 17:40:31","2021-05-27 16:25:38","","","","","","Environ.

Within agricultural landscape mosaics, the arrangement of tree cover such as forests, trees, and hedgerows can positively or negatively impact agricultural productivity in fields. In such settings, forest restoration has the potential to impact food security goals in addition to the typical restoration goals of reversing land degradation and supporting carbon storage. Here, we compare and contrast forest restoration scenarios in order to explore whether there are ideal amounts and configurations of forests that optimize benefits for food production. To do so, we explored forest restoration scenarios in an agricultural-forest landscape in southern Ethiopia where previous research showed increased wheat productivity in sections of fields adjacent to forests. We used hypothetical, historically relevant, and plausible future scenarios to examine the landscape-level implications of forest restoration on total wheat production. To accomplish this, we first characterized contemporary forest cover, as well as long-term trends, using remote sensing. Then, trends in forests and hedgerows were used to create a series of hypothetical yet realistic scenarios to explore trade-offs among total forest cover, its configuration, and total wheat production. From 1967–2013, analysis of historical aerial photography and Landsat imagery showed a general trend of reforestation (an 8% increase in forest cover). While the abundance of primary forests remained constant from 1986–2013, mixed vegetation expanded from 16 % to occupy 26 % of the landscape, generally in the form of small forest fragments with sparse tree cover. Our hypothetical reforestation and hedgerow planting scenarios found that field productivity increases near forest edges resulted in non-linear food production benefits with hedgerow expansion. Benefits to total landscape-level wheat production were almost twice as great when transitioning from low to medium tree cover than when transitioning from medium-high to high tree cover. Furthermore, the benefits of hedgerows on agricultural production were asymptotic; productivity gains eventually levelled off with increasing hedgerows. Our results highlight potential benefits of a landscape approach for enhancing smallholder agricultural productivity in southern Ethiopia and beyond. We argue that considering a landscape perspective can help support food security goals particularly within the context of climate change and should play a more prominent role in forest conservation and restoration.","2020-06","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:40:31","","106888","","","295","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Agriculture; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Year 6; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; K:afforestation; K:ecosystem functions; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:livelihoods; K:land sharing; K:reforestation; K:Ecosystem services; 2016C14-021; K:edge effects; K:Ethiopia; K:forest landscape restoration; K:fragmentation; K:multi-functional landscapes; K:Wheat yields","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing heavily from theory and method in environmental history, this paradigm has focused attention on the role of landscape-scale shifts in land use and land cover in the production of forests. The geography of cities is patchy, dynamic and heterogeneous, with change and differences occurring at much smaller scales (e.g. Jacobs 1961; Clay 1973) compared to coarse scale of stand replacing successions affecting rural forests (Grove et al. Ecosyst Health and Sustain 2(9):e01239, 2016; Pickett et al. Urban Ecosyst 20(1):1–14, 2017). Therefore, trying to understand how urban forests came to be, as well as what they are, requires a research approach that is specific to the land use dynamics of cities and attentive to the social life of urban forests. In response to this methodological gap, this paper describes a research approach called “forest ethnography,” which we are piloting in Baltimore, Maryland as part of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), one of the National Science Foundation's urban Long-term Ecological Research Programs (LTER). As we describe, we propose that an urban forest ethnography approach can contribute to our understanding of both forest environmental history and urban political ecology.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:40:31","","49-63","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer US","","","","2018; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Ecology; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2017PF-031; T:Environmental History; K:urban forests; K:political ecology; 2017PF-030; K:Baltimore, MD; K:dynamic heterogeneity; K:urban ethnography; Year 7  (DL); Year 7 (BH)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on recent coupled conceptualizations of these complex interactions, we characterize human–flood interactions (collective memory and risk-enduring attitude) at a more comprehensive scale than has been attempted to date across 50 US metropolitan statistical areas with a sociohydrologic (SH) model calibrated with accessible local data (historical records of annual peak streamflow, flood insurance loss claims, active insurance policy records, and population density). A cluster analysis on calibrated SH model parameter sets for metropolitan areas identified two dominant behaviors: 1) “risk-enduring” cities with lower flooding defenses and longer memory of past flood loss events and 2) “risk-averse” cities with higher flooding defenses and reduced memory of past flooding. These divergent behaviors correlated with differences in local stream flashiness indices (i.e., the frequency and rapidity of daily changes in streamflow), maximum dam heights, and the proportion of White to non-White residents in US metropolitan areas. Risk-averse cities tended to exist within regions characterized by flashier streamflow conditions, larger dams, and larger proportions of White residents. Our research supports the development of SH models in urban metropolitan areas and the design of risk management strategies that consider both demographically heterogeneous populations, changing flood defenses, and temporal changes in community risk perceptions and tolerance.","2021-03","2021-04-07 15:36:49","2023-12-07 17:40:30","2021-04-07 15:36:49","","","13","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 33723010","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MJH58G75/Knighton et al. - 2021 - Flood risk behaviors of United States riverine met.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/D7MSQ3GE/e2016839118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723010","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; 2019PF-048; T:Vulnerability; Year 9; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2021; K:hydrology; K:hydrologic modeling; K:sociohydrology; K:flood risk; K:insurance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a conspicuous lack of explanation of these structures and, perhaps more importantly, no mention of the corresponding processes necessary to facilitate integration. By not detailing these aspects of their framework, Bennett et al. leave their intent implicit and miss a valuable opportunity to explicate the important role structures and processes perform in interdisciplinary research. As professionals in fields adjacent to conservation have come to understand, the synergistic relationship between structures and processes creates the hospitable environment required for integration and dispels the ad hoc approach to inclusion.

Using longitudinal data, I find that many households used compensation payments to concentrate income generation efforts on the most lucrative strategies—cacao and cattle production and business or rental income. Poorer households and those that received the least compensation were more likely to continue relying on agricultural wage labor—a less desirable income source associated with not owning land or with persons needing to supplement income with additional work as a day laborer. Results also indicate that the amount of compensation received by most households was sufficient to enable them to make productive investments beyond attaining replacement land and housing. Many households invested in assets such as agricultural infrastructure, cattle, rental houses, or tractors—all of which directly contribute to future income. Displacement compensation, similar to remittances or conditional cash transfers, can therefore act as an important infusion of capital to promote socioeconomic development and poverty reduction.","2016-11","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:40:30","","548-573","","3","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","T:Resilience; no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; T:Sociology; K:Displacement; Postdoc; Year 6; 2016; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; K:dams; 2016PF-026; K:compensation payments; K:forced migration; K:household income; K:Rural sociology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For those who survive early life undernutrition, it can cause motor and cognitive development problems that translate into poor educational performance and limited work productivity later in life. It has been suggested that nutrition-specific interventions (e.g., micronutrient supplementation) that directly address the immediate determinants of undernutrition (e.g., nutrient intake) need to be complemented by nutrition-sensitive interventions that more broadly address the underlying determinants of undernutrition (e.g., food insecurity). Here, we argue that forest conservation represents a potentially important but overlooked nutrition-sensitive intervention. Forests can address a number of underlying determinants of undernutrition, including the supply of forest food products, income, habitat for pollinators, women's time allocation, diarrheal disease, and dietary diversity. We examine the effects of forests on stunting—a debilitating outcome of undernutrition—using a database of household surveys and environmental variables across 25 low- and middle-income countries. Our result indicates that exposure to forest significantly reduces child stunting (at least 7.11% points average reduction). The average magnitude of the reduction is at least near the median of the impacts of other known nutrition interventions. Forest conservation interventions typically cover large areas and are often implemented where people are vulnerable, and thus could be used to reach a large number of the world's undernourished communities that may have difficult access to traditional nutrition programs. Forest conservation is therefore a potentially effective nutrition-sensitive intervention. Efforts are needed to integrate specific nutrition goals and actions into forest conservation interventions in order to unleash their potential to deliver nutritional benefits.","2020-03","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:40:30","","20","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers Media SA","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; 2020; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Food security; K:ecosystem services; 2012T1-003; K:demographic and health surveys; K:height-for-age; K:malnutrition; K:partial identification; K:planetary health; K:stunting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insects represent an important group of species in freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and they constitute a large proportion of non-native species. However, while many non-native insects are known from terrestrial ecosystems, they appear to be less represented in freshwater habitats. Comparisons between freshwater and terrestrial habitats of invader richness relative to native species richness are scarce, which hinders syntheses of invasion processes. Here, we used data from three regions on different continents to determine whether non-native insects are indeed under-represented in freshwater compared with terrestrial assemblages. Location Europe, North America, New Zealand. Methods We compiled a comprehensive inventory of native and non-native insect species established in freshwater and terrestrial habitats of the three study regions. We then contrasted the richness of non-native and native species among freshwater and terrestrial insects for all insect orders in each region. Using binomial regression, we analysed the proportions of non-native species in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Marine insect species were excluded from our analysis, and insects in low-salinity brackish water were considered as freshwater insects. Results In most insect orders living in freshwater, non-native species were under-represented, while they were over-represented in a number of terrestrial orders. This pattern occurred in purely aquatic orders and in orders with both freshwater and terrestrial species. Overall, the proportion of non-native species was significantly lower in freshwater than in terrestrial species. Main conclusions Despite the numerical and ecological importance of insects among all non-native species, non-native insect species are surprisingly rare in freshwater habitats. This is consistent across the three investigated regions. We review hypotheses concerning species traits and invasion pathways that are most likely to explain these patterns. Our findings contribute to a growing appreciation of drivers and impacts of biological invasions.","2022-09","2023-06-05 14:19:31","2023-12-07 17:40:29","2023-06-05 14:19:31","2303-2315","","11","28","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2022 The Authors.

However, relatively few studies examine the “legacy effect” of historical patterns. In flood risk studies specifically, several scholars have highlighted the role of systemic processes in historically shaping and producing observed disparities in flood risk patterns. These studies reveal that such relations are tied to histories of racialized land struggles and territorial dispossessions. In this paper, I argue that scholars need to do more than quantify today’s disproportionate burdens across social difference or explain the systemic processes causing those disparities. I suggest that “legacy vulnerability” helps identify how the potential for harm from flood risk to marginalized groups may reside in events of the past that have imprinted a spatially hidden, but spatiotemporally revealed unjust pattern upon today’s landscape. In a flood risk assessment of Sapelo Island, the initial results suggest that when comparing contemporary flood risk of Sapelo’s Geechee descendant (Black and mostly low-to-middle income) to non-descendant newcomer owners (mostly white and affluent) an environmental justice disparity in proportional flood risk burden does not exist. However, results of a counterfactual flood risk assessment show that approximately one-third of historically owned, Geechee property is located outside the contemporary 100-year flood zone compared to zero percent outside of it today. In other words, roughly one-third of Geechee property’s flood risk today is a legacy vulnerability directly tied to racialized land dispossessions that unfolded in the middle twentieth century.","2023-04","2023-05-08 17:07:03","2023-12-07 17:40:29","2023-05-08 17:07:03","103757","","","142","","Geoforum","Flood Risk as Legacy Vulnerability","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GGEMYBG9/Hardy - 2023 - Flood Risk as Legacy Vulnerability Reading the pa.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2AUMR8AD/S0016718523000830.html","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; Year 6; F:Water & People; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Risk; T:Vulnerability; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; F:Case study collection; 2023; 2016PF-028; wrong DBI; T:Environmental History; K:Environmental justice; K:Gullah Geechee; K:Legacy effect; K:Flood risk; K:Sapelo Island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present analysis examines the robustness of a physical method proposed three decades ago to identify coupled anomalies as of atmospheric or oceanic origin by analyzing 850 mb vorticity and sea surface temperature anomalies. The method is then used as a metric to assess the coupling in climate simulations and a 30-year hindcast from models of the CMIP5 project. Analysis of the frequency of coupled anomalies exceeding one standard deviation from uncoupled NCEP/NCAR and ERA-Interim and partially coupled CFSR reanalyses shows robustness in the main results: anomalies of oceanic origin arise inside the deep tropics and those of atmospheric origin outside of the tropics. Coupled anomalies occupy similar regions in the global oceans independently of the spatiotemporal resolution. Exclusion of phenomena like ENSO, NAO, or AMO has regional effects on the distribution and origin of coupled anomalies; the absence of ENSO decreases anomalies of oceanic origin and favors those of atmospheric origin. Coupled model simulations in general agree with the distribution of anomalies of atmospheric and oceanic origin from reanalyses. However, the lack of the feedback from the atmosphere to the ocean in the AMIP simulations reduces substantially the number of coupled anomalies of atmospheric origin and artificially increases it in the tropics while the number of those of oceanic origin outside the tropics is also augmented. Analysis of a single available 30-year hindcast surprisingly indicates that coupled anomalies are more similar to AMIP than to coupled simulations. Differences in the frequency of coupled anomalies between the AMIP simulations and the uncoupled reanalyses, and similarities between the uncoupled and partially coupled reanalyses, support the notion that the nature of the coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere is transmitted into the reanalyses via the assimilation of observations.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:40:29","","2153–2172","","7-8","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2017; T:Climate Change; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:CMIP5; K:coupled anomalies; K:driver of coupled anomalies; K:ocean-atmosphere coupling; K:SST; K:vorticity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef fish communities at 38 US-affiliated Pacific islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers. Size spectra ‘steepened' steadily with increasing human population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the relative biomass of large fishes and an increase in the dominance of small fishes. Reef fish biomass was substantially lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased (analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef fish biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being influenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure may be a more robust indicator than fish biomass to increasing human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of exploitation impacts across regions of different fish community compositions, environmental drivers, and fisheries types. Size-based approaches that link directly to functional properties of fish communities, and are relatively insensitive to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great potential for developing our understanding of fishing impacts in coral reef ecosystems.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:40:29","","1009–1022","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","65 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8L7D8KI2/Robinson et al. - 2017 - Fishing degrades size structure of coral reef fish.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QPPZXN7M/gcb.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Ecology; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Fisheries; 2014PF-015; K:macroecology; K:body size; K:community structure; K:coral reef fish; K:exploitation; K:fisheries; K:overfishing; K:size spectra; K:size-based approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of 28 fishers, conservationists, marine scientists and fisheries managers from Cuba, Mexico and the U.S. gathered at Siguanea Bay off the island's southwest coast. The goals of the exchange were to 1) provide a forum for sea turtle experts and fishing communities in Cuba, Mexico, and the U.S. to share experiences on conservation activities, 2) develop the scientific basis for future conservation in this highly biologically important region of Cuba, and 3) increase support by Cuban fishers for local sea turtle conservation efforts. During the exchange, participants met with local Cuban fishers about the challenges of conserving sea turtle populations while maintaining their fishing livelihoods, shared solutions developed by fishers to accomplish the same in Mexico, and undertook field and cultural activities. Key outcomes for the exchange include an improved understanding of sea turtle bycatch off the Isla de la Juventud, enhanced collaboration among the three nations in turtle conservation, and increased motivation by fishers to participate in sea turtle research and conservation. Additionally, as a direct result of this exchange, the community of Cocodrilo on the Isla de la Juventud has hosted annual sea turtle festivals that increase support for turtle conservation efforts by the local community.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:40:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PAHWCGDA/S0308597X16303062.html","","2017; no acknowledgment; Year 1; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Team Science & Collaborations; Workshop; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Fisheries; 2012W-005; K:Fisheries; K:Fisheries bycatch; K:Marine conservation; K:Sea turtle conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing evaluation strategies have yet to ascertain the extent to which MSP achieves social, ecological, and economic goals to benefit coastal environments and human communities. Here, we experiment with a theory-based approach as a means of overcoming long-standing obstacles to MSP evaluation. We developed and applied an eight-step evaluation protocol to five diverse cases of MSP, focusing on the evaluative feasibility of the protocol as we moved from identifying objectives to assessing the sustainability of outcomes. We found evidence that theory-based evaluation (operationalized via theories of change) can bridge quantitative outcome and qualitative process evaluations, two essential approaches that on their own produce incomplete pictures of MSP. Our work suggests that a theory-based approach can enhance opportunities to incorporate diverse knowledge sources and data types into outcome evaluations and thus better capture complex social, political, and historical dimensions that are difficult to quantify but critical to MSP success. We also uncovered likely challenges to implementing theory-based evaluation for MSP, including the apparent data- and time-intensive nature of the approach. We found that applying theory-based evaluation is difficult for plans lacking well-defined goals, objectives, and intended outcomes and that increased documentation of planning motivations and the planning process are needed to rigorously evaluate MSP. Ultimately, we join others in the marine conservation and management fields who are optimistic about theory-based evaluation. Our evaluation protocol provides a first step towards a practical guide to accelerate the use of this assessment approach.","2023-04","2023-06-02 16:33:08","2023-12-07 17:40:28","2023-06-02 16:33:08","106594","","","239","","Ocean & Coastal Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A4RZR5IK/Zuercher et al. - 2023 - Exploring the potential of theory-based evaluation.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QBNKW3PY/S0964569123001199.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Actionable Research; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2023; F:Research Frameworks; T:Coasts & Shorelines; Year 10; 2020PF-050; K:Marine spatial planning; K:MSP evaluation; K:Theory of change; K:Theory-based evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, species’ populations are often already highly vulnerable to extinction by the time they are listed, making their recovery challenging. In recent decades, increasing emphasis has been placed on proactive efforts to conserve species that are being considered for listing under the ESA before they are listed (i.e., preemptive conservation); the aim is to increase conservation benefits while avoiding the regulatory burdens and costs associated with ESA listings. Such conservation and listing outcomes depend on the cumulative effect of voluntary actions by public and private land managers across the species’ range. Engagement in conservation actions is influenced by the costs, benefits, and barriers that land managers face, which can be affected by their social, economic, environmental, and institutional context. In this study, we explore the importance of contextual factors that we hypothesized could influence voluntary decisions to promote or inhibit preemptive conservation of species that are under consideration for ESA listing. We empirically estimate each factor's association with preemptive conservation outcomes, using data for a set of species that entered the ESA listing process and were either officially listed (n = 314) or preemptively conserved (n = 73) between 1996 and 2018. We find that factors associated with precluded listing due to preemptive conservation include higher baseline conservation status, a lower proportion of private land across the species’ range, smaller total range size, facing specific types of threats, and the species’ range occurring in a greater number of states. These results can help inform conservation strategies to further promote preemptive conservation outcomes, including targeting resources toward imperiled species earlier in the listing process, addressing specific threats, and expanding incentives and coordination mechanisms to further encourage preemptive conservation actions by private landowners.

As a dense source of bioavailable nutrients, aquatic foods can help alleviate such deficiencies. Developing aquaculture that provides critical micronutrients without sacrificing the underlying environmental resources that support these food production systems is therefore essential. Here, we address these dual challenges by optimizing nutrient supply while constraining the environmental impacts from aquaculture. Using life cycle assessment and nutritional data from Indonesia, a top aquaculture producer, we sought to identify aquaculture systems that increase micronutrient supplies and reduce environmental impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, freshwater pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions). Aquaculture systems in Indonesia vary more by environmental impacts (e.g. three order of magnitude for fresh water usage) than by nutritional differences (approximately ± 50% differences from mean relative nutritional score). Nutritional-environmental tradeoffs exist, with no single system offering a complete nutrition-environment win–win. We also find that previously proposed future aquaculture paths suboptimally balance nutritional and environmental impacts. Instead, we identify optimized aquaculture production scenarios for 2030 with nutrient per gram densities 105–320% that of business-as-usual production and with environmental impacts as low as 25% of those of business-as-usual. In these scenarios Pangasius fish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) ponds prove desirable due to their low environmental impacts, but average relative nutrient score. While the environmental impacts of the three analyzed brackish water systems range from average to high compared to other aquaculture systems, their nutritional attributes render them necessary when maximizing all nutrients except vitamin A. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) ponds also proved essential in maximizing zinc and omega n-3, while Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cages were necessary in optimizing the production of calcium and vitamin A. These optimal aquaculture strategies also reduce business-as-usual demand for wild fish-based feed by 0–30% and mangrove expansion by 0–75% with no additional expansion into inland open waters and freshwater ponds. As aquaculture production expands globally, optimization presents a powerful opportunity to reduce malnutrition rates at reduced environmental impacts. The proposed reorientation promotes UN Sustainable Development Goals 2 (zero hunger), 3 (health), 13 (climate action) and 14 (life under water) and requires concerted and targeted policy changes.","2021-07","2021-05-27 12:40:52","2023-12-07 17:40:28","2021-05-27 12:40:52","","","","69","","Global Environmental Change","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FMQ26W7J/Shepon et al. - 2021 - Exploring sustainable aquaculture development usin.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8GFI6MVM/S0959378021000649.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Pollution; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2021; T:Fisheries; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; K:Micronutrient deficiencies; K:Aquatic foods; K:Development scenarios; K:Fish consumption; K:Nutrition-sensitive aquaculture; K:Optimization; K:Planetary health; K:Seafood; K:Sustainable food systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we derived a high-spatial resolution (1.2 m) land-use/land-cover map for the tropical city of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and examined how socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., population density, socioeconomic status, detached homes, homeownership, and householder’s age) relate to residential tree canopy cover at the neighborhood scale. We found that previous theory developed in North American cities applied only partially to Santo Domingo. Of the five socioeconomic variables examined, only two showed relationships with tree canopy consistent with previous findings from North American cities. In particular, socioeconomic status, one of the better-studied correlates of urban tree canopy, was not positively associated with tree canopy cover. At the same time, our new land-use/land-cover map revealed the presence of important areas with low levels of tree canopy cover, which may require additional attention by city planners. Our study reinforces the value of high-spatial resolution satellite data for examining urban areas, and highlights the need for further understanding the characteristics related to the distribution of tree canopy cover outside North America.","2021-04","2021-04-07 14:54:44","2023-12-07 17:40:28","2021-04-07 14:54:44","127125","","","62","","Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","Exploring the relationships between tree canopy cover and socioeconomic characteristics in tropical urban systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VAXHUGRU/S1618866721001503.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 7; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2021; Fellow; 2017PF-031; K:urban forestry; K:Caribbean; K:remote sensing; K:tree canopy; K:urban ecology; K:Latin America; K:WorldView-3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These farmers are already adapting to the increased risk of flooding; however, some of their actions may affect communities downstream, both human and ecological. This case study examines the competing perspectives of farmers and other community stakeholders in New England as farmers work to adapt to increasing flood impacts.

Understanding dispersed patterns of urban development is important for designing policies for mitigating the environmental and other adverse effects of urban “sprawl”. The model includes as agents heterogeneous farmer/landowners and housing consumers, and a representative developer who buys land and builds houses. Underlying economic behavior of consumer utility maximization and developer and farmer profit maximization is assumed. A unique feature of the model is that housing is characterized by variation in both lot size and house size, allowing for exploration of the effects of changes in key parameters on both land and housing markets and the interaction between them. The paper explores the relative importance of consumer preferences, spatial distribution of agricultural productivity, and travel costs in creating sprawling development patterns. Consumer preferences for large lots do result in more land in development and lower density, but leap frog development in the model appears to be driven by other economic influences as well. And, in general, more stable housing prices mute the effect of more variable land prices and tend to dampen the effects of economic shocks to the urbanizing area.","2015-05","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:40:27","","114–125","","","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZL2E7XEF/S0921800915000671.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7DQC9LGD/S0921800915000671.html","","Staff; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Economics; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; 2015; T:Agriculture; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:agent-based modeling (ABM); K:Computational methods; K:Housing density; K:Land conversion; K:Urban fringe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following a brief review of existing research, we outline some important new directions. We also highlight 2 key divergences, arguing that psychological research needs to expand beyond a traditional, theory-based and decontextualized approach to environmental issues to incorporate a contextualized or ""place-based"" approach and a willingness to collaborate in interdisciplinary research teams that focus on specific environmental problems.

Archaeology is the study of interactions of natural and social environments through time and across space. As well, the field of cultural resources management, which includes archaeology, regularly engages with values such as site significance and allocation of funding that the modern social environment ascribes to its own history. Through these two approaches, archaeology has potential to provide both data for and methods of addressing challenges the global community faces through climate change. To date, however, archaeology and related areas of cultural heritage have had relatively little role in the global climate response.

Among 5 designed TMPs, the optimal TMPs for each site and cropping system were selected, which achieved the sustainable targets for productivity (80% of the achievable yield potential), NUE (0.60), and economic profitability. But several TMPs failed to satisfy the integrated targets, which implied the TMPs must be carefully designed to fit site-specific biophysical contexts. This work provided some basic guidelines for determining each “R”: The “Right rate” can be determined by balancing with crop aboveground N uptake where soil testing is not always available. The “Right timing” must consider the fertilizer products and local climatic features. Split application is not always better than one-time application, e.g., applying urea at 11th-leaf stage decreased spring maize yield by 9% at Lishu due to a 20-day sustained high temperature and drought condition. For the “Right source”, the adoption of enhanced efficiency fertilizers should take soil properties (especially soil pH) into consideration, e.g., urease inhibitors are effective in increasing NUE (by 44%) on alkaline soils, but the efficacy on acid soils is greatly reduced (by 19%). The “Right place” needs to be designed according to characteristics of crop root distribution and fertilizer sources, e.g., surface application of urease inhibitors in winter wheat gained greater NUE (0.62) and grain yield (8.3 Mg ha−1) than deep placement of urea and calcium ammonium nitrate. Considering the biophysical condition variations and its great influence on TMPs, a long-term trial research network to design, test and reshape the site-specific optimal TMPs following “4R” principles will be necessary.","2019-12","2020-11-17 20:30:10","2023-12-07 17:40:27","","118295","","","241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JPVND2IP/Li et al. - 2019 - Exploring optimal nitrogen management practices within site-specific ecological and socioeconomic conditions.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SZQHNIMR/S0959652619331658.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2019; Year 7; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Pollution; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017C17-025; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:4R nutrient stewardship; K:Agricultural sustainability; K:Design principles; K:Efficacy; K:Enhanced efficiency fertilizers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them.

Racial experiences are inseparable from physical landscapes and the processes of designing, managing, or studying them. From COVID-19 to the Black Lives Matter movement and protests, the events of 2020 in the United States underscore how considerations of social justice must extend beyond the conventional distributional focus of environmental justice. It must incorporate an understanding of how the built environment is racialized spatially, but not always readily quantified through the proximity-based measurements frequently used in research and practice. The perspective is organized in three main parts. The first part presents a series of vignettes to frame the ways cities and individuals participate, respond, and interact under COVID-19 with racial segregation as the backdrop. The second part suggests a stepwise approach to building an understanding of racial inequities in socio-ecological systems (SES) research and practice including four entry points: (1) racialized spatial distribution of hazards and amenities, (2) racialized qualities of space, (3) racialized people in space, and (4) racialized creation of space. Finally, the third part proposes actions the SES community can take to enhance our commitment to community recovery, improvement, and thrivability. This perspective cautions practitioners and researchers against opportunistic or quick-fix solutions, and instead challenges our colleagues to be inclusive of disenfranchised voices in shaping socio-ecological goals, now more than ever. The goal of this perspective is to spark engagement with power and privilege in parks and open space using the example of COVID-19 and race in the United States.","2020-11","2020-12-07 16:08:15","2023-12-07 17:40:26","2020-12-07 16:08:15","55-70","","","3","","Socio Ecol Pract Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","37 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W6AF5CSL/Hoover and Lim - 2020 - Examining privilege and power in US urban parks an.pdf","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; 2020; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Year 9; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2019PF-047; K:COVID-19; K:Environmental racism; K:Green space; K:Parks; K:racial segregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, since MPA networks often involve large geographic areas, they also affect and involve multiple actors, institutions, and policy sectors. A key challenge when establishing an effective MPA network is to align the ‘social system’ with the biophysical MPA network (the ‘ecological system’). This challenge is often denoted as ‘social–ecological fit’. Facilitating collaborative social interactions among various actors and stakeholders (social connectivity) is equally as important as accomplishing ecological connectivity. New analytical approaches are required to effectively examine this ‘social’ dimension of fit. An emerging marine reserve network in Jamaica and the recent invasion of Indo-Pacific lionfish are used as a case study to: (1) examine the extent to which horizontal and vertical social ties bring local and national actors together to collaborate, coordinate, and share knowledge; and (2) assess the extent to which different attributes and features of such multilevel social networks may enhance or inhibit particular aspects of social–ecological fit. Findings suggest that multilevel linkages have played the greatest role in relation to enhancing fit in the marine reserve network in the context of the recent lionfish invasion. However, the long-term propensity of the multi-actor and multilevel networks to enhance social–ecological fit is uncertain given the prevalence of weak social ties, lack of a culture of information sharing and collaboration, and limited financial resources.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:40:26","","1209-1223","","6","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; no acknowledgment; T:Social Science; Postdoc; T:Conservation; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:Marine protected area (MPA); F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2016PF-023; K:social networks; K:governance networks; K:invasion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agent-based modeling, as a ‘generative social science’ tool, appears ideal for this. Here we propose an agent-based virtual laboratory (ABVL) approach to generating and testing basic hypotheses on SNC as a general mechanism capable of producing the broadly varied anthroecological forms and dynamics of human landscapes from prehistory to present.

We propose that these long-term changes are coupled through positive feedbacks among social and environmental changes, coevolved primarily through selection acting at the group level and above, and that this can be tested by combining archeological evidence with mechanistic experiments using an agent-based virtual laboratory (ABVL) approach.

In addition, billions of U.S. public dollars are dedicated annually toward soil conservation programs, and yet, it is not well quantified how investment in conservation programs improve soil health and, more broadly, environmental health. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is one of the major U.S. public conservation programs administered on privately managed lands for which public data are available. In this research, we developed a multi-dimensional classification system to evaluate over 300 EQIP practices to identify to what extent practices have the potential to improve different aspects of soil and environmental health. Using available descriptions and expert opinion, these practices were evaluated with a classification system based on the practice’s potential to exhibit the following environmental health outcomes: i) principles of soil health to reduce soil disturbance and increase agrobiodiversity; ii) a transition to ecologically-based management to conserve soil, water, energy and biological resources; and iii) adaptive strategy to confer agroecosystem resilience. Further, we analyzed nearly $7 billion U.S. dollars of financial assistance dedicated to these practices from 2009 through 2018 to explore the potential of these investments to generate environmental health outcomes. We identified nine practices that fit the highest level of potential environmental health outcomes in our classification systems. These included wetlands and agroforestry related practices, demonstrating that ecologically complex practices can provide the broadest benefits to environmental health. Practices with the greatest potential to improve environmental health in our classification system represent 2-27% of annual EQIP funding between 2009 and 2018. In fiscal year 2018, these practices represented between $13 and $121 million, which represented approximately 0.08% of total annual USDA expenditures. These classifications and the subsequent funding analysis provide evidence that there is tremendous untapped potential for conservation programs to confer greater environmental health in U.S. agriculture. This analysis provides a new framework for assessing conservation investments as a driver for transformative agricultural change.","2020-11","2021-05-28 19:31:24","2023-12-07 17:40:25","2021-05-28 19:31:24","","","","4","","Front.

Watershed restoration practices, such as infiltration-based stormwater management, are implemented to mitigate the detrimental effects of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. However, their effectiveness for restoring hydrologic processes and watershed storage remains poorly understood. Our study used a comparative hydrology approach to quantify the effects of urban watershed restoration on watershed hydrologic function in headwater streams within the Coastal Plain of Maryland, USA. We selected 11 headwater streams that spanned an urbanization–restoration gradient (4 forested, 4 urban-degraded, and 3 urban-degraded) to evaluate changes in watershed hydrologic function from both urbanization and watershed restoration. Discrete discharge and continuous, high-frequency rainfall-stage monitoring were conducted in each watershed. These datasets were used to develop 6 hydrologic metrics describing changes in watershed storage, flowpath connectivity, or the resultant stream flow regime. The hydrological effects of urbanization were clearly observed in all metrics, but only 1 of the 3 restored watersheds exhibited partially restored hydrologic function. At this site, a larger minimum runoff threshold was observed relative to the urban-degraded watersheds, suggesting enhanced infiltration of stormwater runoff within the restoration structure. However, baseflow in the stream draining this watershed remained low compared to the forested reference streams, suggesting that enhanced infiltration of stormwater runoff did not recharge subsurface storage zones contributing to stream baseflow. The highly variable responses among the 3 restored watersheds were likely due to the spatial heterogeneity of urban development, including the level of impervious cover and extent of the storm sewer network. This study yielded important knowledge on how restoration strategies, such as infiltration-based stormwater management, modulated—or failed to modulate—hydrological processes affected by urbanization, which will help improve the design of future urban watershed management strategies. More broadly, we highlighted a multimetric approach that can be used to monitor the restoration of headwater stream ecosystems in disturbed landscapes.","2017-09","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:40:25","","3306–3319","","19","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4AIG4F9M/Fanelli et al. - 2017 - Evaluation of infiltration-based stormwater manage.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; T:Engineering & Design; K:Urbanization; K:Stormwater; K:restoration; K:Hydrologic connectivity; K:stream ecosystems; K:watershed storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultural evolution suggests that cultural adaptations such as practices and institutions arise as a result of evolutionary selection pressure. The cultural multilevel selection framework of Waring et al. (Ecol Soc, 2015) further proposes that group cultural adaptations tend to emerge at a level of social organization corresponding to the underlying dilemma. Drawing on detailed history and ethnography, we conduct a retrospective assessment to determine which levels of social organization experienced selection pressures that might explain the emergence of lobstering territoriality and conservation practices we observe in history. The evidence strongly suggests that informal territoriality evolved by selection on harbor gang behavior, while some conservation practices spread via selection at other levels from individuals to regional lobstering zones. We identify two apparent historical shifts in the dominant level of selection for these practices over the history of the industry and discuss the implications of this trajectory for the evolution of lobster management in the Gulf of Maine.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:40:25","","1–14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Japan","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H4ICIQ7K/Waring and Acheson - 2018 - Evidence of cultural group selection in territoria.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VE87BHV6/10.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; F:Water & People; Year 3; T:Fisheries; K:cooperation; 2014V-028; K:cultural evolution; K:Venture; K:fisheries management; K:cultural group selection; K:lobster; K:territoriality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the variety of processes contributing to nutrient patchiness, and the wide range of spatial and temporal scales at which these processes operate, obfuscate how this spatial heterogeneity is generated. Here, we describe the spatial structure of stream nutrient concentration, quantify the relative importance of the physical template and biological processes, and detect and evaluate the role of self-organization in driving such patterns. We examined nutrient spatial patterns in Sycamore Creek, an intermittent desert stream in Arizona that experienced an ecosystem regime shift [from a gravel/algae-dominated to a vascular plant-dominated (hereafter, ""wetland"") system] in 2000 when cattle grazing ceased. We conducted high-resolution nutrient surveys in surface water along a 10-km stream reach over four visits spanning 18 y (1995-2013) that represent different successional stages and prewetland stage vs. postwetland state. As expected, groundwater upwelling had a major influence on nutrient spatial patterns. However, self-organization realized by the mechanism of spatial feedbacks also was significant and intensified over ecosystem succession, as a resource (nitrogen) became increasingly limiting. By late succession, the effects of internal spatial feedbacks and groundwater upwelling were approximately equal in magnitude. Wetland establishment influenced nutrient spatial patterns only indirectly, by modifying the extent of surface water/groundwater exchange. This study illustrates that multiple mechanisms interact in a dynamic way to create spatial heterogeneity in riverine ecosystems, and provides a means to detect spatial self-organization against physical template heterogeneity as a dominant driver of spatial patterns.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:40:25","","E4744–E4752","","24","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: National Academy of Sciences PMID: 28559326","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QD89KFBI/Dong et al. - 2017 - Evidence for self-organization in determining spat.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3K99QICZ/E4744.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559326","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; 2017; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; Year 6; F:Water & People; 2016PF-025; T:Disturbance; K:ecosystem succession; K:spatial feedbacks; K:spatial heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, global estimates of the effect of land cover change on urban water-treatment costs have been hampered by a lack of global information on urban source watersheds. Here, we use a unique map of the urban source watersheds for 309 large cities (population > 750,000), combined with long-term data on anthropogenic land-use change in their source watersheds and data on water-treatment costs. We show that anthropogenic activity is highly correlated with sediment and nutrient pollution levels, which is in turn highly correlated with treatment costs. Over our study period (1900–2005), median population density has increased by a factor of 5.4 in urban source watersheds, whereas ranching and cropland use have increased by a factor of 3.4 and 2.0, respectively. Nearly all (90%) of urban source watersheds have had some level of watershed degradation, with the average pollutant yield of urban source watersheds increasing by 40% for sediment, 47% for phosphorus, and 119% for nitrogen. We estimate the degradation of watersheds over our study period has impacted treatment costs for 29% of cities globally, with operation and maintenance costs for impacted cities increasing on average by 53 ± 5% and replacement capital costs increasing by 44 ± 14%. We discuss why this widespread degradation might be occurring, and strategies cities have used to slow natural land cover loss.","2016-07","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:40:24","","9117–9122","","32","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","93 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 27457941","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6JFHHS7N/McDonald et al. - 2016 - Estimating watershed degradation over the last cen.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6LSDB3N9/9117.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457941","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2016; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; T:Engineering & Design; K:ecosystem services; K:land use change; K:watershed; 2012T1-005; K:water treatment; K:History Database of the Global Environment; K:operations and maintenance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explore the impact of competition for contracts on contractor pollution in sectors that handle chromium, a toxic, yet necessary, component in many goods. We find that competition alone has negligible impact on overall chromium releases among contractors; however, the way chromium is used in the manufacturing process does. Contractors that use chromium as a component report higher releases of chromium waste than contractors that only use chromium in non-incorporative ways. However, when contractors face higher competition for contracts, pollution levels significantly decrease. This suggests that both competition and the use of the metal are important.

Two approaches, physical trade flow analysis and multi-regional input–output analysis have been frequently used for land accounting of international trade leading to diametrically opposed results for countries such as China. In this study, we investigate and explain the differences by comparing the estimates of cropland embodied in international trade for China from studies using physical trade flows (PTF) and multi-regional input–output (MRIO) analysis and provide a step-wise calculation to explain the gap between estimates from these different approaches and their interpretation. Our results show that the gap between PTF and MRIO is largely due to the system boundary selection and truncation errors from the boundary cut-off. These two approaches should be used for different research purposes. If focusing on the flows of a particular product, in particular primary products such as rice, wheat or other grains, among countries the higher level of detail of physical flow model is more suited. Whereas when accounting for the total embodied land in trade and consumption-based land use by recipient countries to analyze drivers of land use, MRIO is more suitable for tracking entire global supply chains.","2016-01","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:40:05","","194–201","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","72 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A79NYXJB/Hubacek and Feng - 2016 - Comparing apples and oranges Some confusion about.pdf","","no acknowledgment; T:Economics; T:Agriculture; Venture; T:Methods & Methodology; 2016; 2014V-027; Year 3; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:international trade; K:china; K:embodied land; K:multiregional input-output analysis; K:physical trade flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this process, existing hard structures, such as sea walls and riprap evetments, are supplemented with habitat forming species, e.g., oysters and mangrove trees, to improve habitat quality and function. Shoreline restorations in Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, often utilize red mangroves, Rhizophora mangle (Linneaus, 1753), in addition to riprap revetments, to help stabilize the shoreline. This riprap-mangrove habitat provides structure for marine organisms to utilize and is believed to improve shoreline habitats in areas previously cleared of mangroves. We examined whether habitat provisioning was similar between restored mangrove habitat with the inclusion of riprap boulders and natural mangrove shorelines. We compared fish assemblages between natural mangrove and riprapmangrove habitats within two areas of northern Biscayne Bay. Fish community structure and certain benthic cover types varied between mangroves and riprap-mangrove habitats. Total fish abundance was greater in mangrove habitat, while taxonomic richness was highest in riprap-mangrove sites in the northern part of the bay. Our findings suggest that fish assemblages and community structure are different between these habitat types, although the geographic context may mediate the effect of habitat type. Therefore, it is likely that these restored mangroves provide different ecological services than unaltered mangrove shorelines.","2015-04","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:40:05","","125–139","","2","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; F:Built Environment; 2015; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Fisheries; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2014PF-015; K:mangroves; K:restoration; K:fish population data; K:mangal; K:natural wetlands; K:restored wetlands; K:wetland fish","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, given the dynamic nature of cities and the profound effects of variable land uses on green space provisioning for people and wildlife, investigating community gardens from a landscape perspective offers valuable insight into the functions of these spaces in terms of ecosystem services and sustainable development. In this study, we use garden locations provided by stakeholder groups and fine-scale spatial data to compare community gardens across three cities: New York City, NY, Chicago, IL, and Baltimore, MD (USA). In each city, we assess the spatial distribution of gardens and compare the natural vegetation and impervious surface cover within these gardens to the surrounding neighborhood and landscape. We then compared these cities to clarify the role of community gardens in metropolitan development. Our findings demonstrate that gardens cluster in neighborhoods in New York City and Chicago, but they are more spatially distributed across the landscape in Baltimore. The distribution of Baltimore’s community gardens is more likely to be contributing to a greater network of ecosystem services across a broader urban landscape. Moreover, at the garden scale, gardens in NYC and Chicago have more canopy cover and built infrastructure than the more herbaceous gardens in Baltimore. This suggests that our case study cities exhibit different garden typologies, histories, and potential for ecosystem services. This work provides critical insight into the typology in and around community gardens in different cities, which is useful in understanding the potential ecosystem services and planning trajectories of these cities.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:34:42","2023-12-07 17:40:05","","671-681","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer US","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZGU9RB4X/Anderson et al. - 2019 - Comparing community garden typologies of Baltimore.pdf","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Agriculture; 2019; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Year 6; K:ecosystem services; K:green infrastructure; K:land use; 2017GS-002; K:distribution; K:grad Pursuit; K:urban agriculture; K:urban greening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the economic theory of comparative advantage, countries open to trade will be able to consume more–in terms of volume and diversity–if they concentrate production on commodities that they can most cost-effectively produce, while importing goods that are expensive to produce, relative to other countries. Here, we perform a global analysis of traded commercial plant products and find little evidence that increasing globalization has incentivized agricultural specialization. Instead, a country’s plant production and consumption patterns are still largely determined by local evolutionary legacies of plant diversification. Because tropical countries harbor a greater diversity of lineages across the tree of life than temperate countries, tropical countries produce and consume a greater diversity of plant products than do temperate countries. In contrast, the richer and more economically advanced temperate countries have the capacity to produce and consume more plant species than the generally poorer tropical countries, yet this collection of plant species is drawn from fewer branches on the tree of life. Why have countries not increasingly specialized in plant production despite the theoretical financial incentive to do so? Potential explanations include the persistence of domestic agricultural subsidies that distort production decisions, cultural preferences for diverse local food production, and that diverse food production protects rural households in developing countries from food price shocks. Less specialized production patterns will make crop systems more resilient to zonal climatic and social perturbations, but this may come at the expense of global crop production efficiency, an important step in making the transition to a hotter and more crowded world.","2016-10-05","2020-11-17 20:35:24","2023-12-07 17:40:04","2021-11-22 19:49:23","","","10","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","5 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/K2VXT7Q7/Nelson et al. - 2016 - Commercial Plant Production and Consumption Still .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WFVGTRBW/article.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; Year 2; T:Agriculture; F:Biodiversity; K:biodiversity; 2016; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; K:plants; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:species diversity; 2012V-011; K:crops; K:food; K:latitude; K:phylogenetics; K:plant phylogenetics; K:venture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We further investigated how maternal habitat and soil conditions manifested in the seedling stage. We determined seed quality and seedling performance by combining isotopic analyses in seed quality with field observations of P. armata fruit production and a common–garden experiment. Soil conditions in forest fragments negatively impacted P. armata reproductive success. Trees of P. armata in forest fragments were smaller in size and produced fewer fruits and smaller seeds with lower quality compared with trees from the continuous forest. The combined effects of maternal habitat and soil conditions determined seedling survival and growth of this tropical tree. Notably, seedlings had restricted plasticity for biomass allocation to roots, limiting the capacity of fragmented populations to compensate for the initial low N content in seeds. Trees in forest fragments at Los Tuxtlas produced offspring competitively inferior and potentially less resilient than counterparts in continuous forest, jeopardizing future persistence of this late-successional tree species.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:40:04","","811-820","","6","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7VZJHLQ9/Zambrano et al. - 2017 - Combined effects of seed and soil quality drive se.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MHV392H8/btp.html","","T:Landscapes at Risk; 2017; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Conservation; 2015PF-017; K:forests; K:common-garden experiment; K:forest; K:late-successional tree; K:parental investment; K:reproductive success; K:seed germination; K:stable isotopes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethiopia committed to restore more than one-sixth of its land. Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, and Colombia pledged to restore huge areas within their borders. In total, parties committed to restore a staggering 350 million hectares by 2030.  The ambition affirms restoration’s growing importance in environmental policy. These new commitments follow the 2010 Aichi Convention on Biological Diversity (to restore at least 15% of degraded ecosystems globally) and the 2011 Bonn Challenge (to restore 150 million hectares). Particularly when accompanied by policies to reduce further losses (as in the New York Declaration), restoration of such magnitude holds promise to address global environmental concerns.  Achieving this promise requires careful thought about how we restore ecosystems.

These collaborations often result in novel insights into the dynamics and feedbacks that occur within these systems. Achieving these insights requires methods and tools that integrate diverse knowledge from multiple disciplines and sectors of society to inform actionable research on complex systems. Past research has demonstrated the contributions that stakeholders can make to defining scenarios that are subsequently applied to quantitative modeling. Here, we focus on the feedback from quantitative modeling to refinement and interpretation of scenarios, and demonstrate how quantitative modeling can reveal aspects of system dynamics that were not considered during scenario development. We present a case study in which we use qualitative scenario planning as a tool to engender systems thinking by a diverse set of stakeholders in a complex transboundary SES: the Mongolian Plateau. This exercise demonstrated the value of participatory scenario planning as a tool for facilitating interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral dialog and knowledge generation. It also ensured the integration of place-based knowledge into scenario development for subsequent quantitative modeling. In addition to incorporating stakeholder knowledge in simulation of complex human-environment dynamics, the quantitative modeling revealed how the dynamics of rural out-migration contribute to the decoupling of rural herder populations and livestock numbers. The emergent knowledge gained from this process underscores the utility of pairing the qualitative scenarios with quantitative simulations to reveal unanticipated system behavior and key drivers not identified or overlooked by stakeholders.","2018-04","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:40:04","","","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6NXKT8IN/Allington et al. - 2018 - Combining participatory scenario planning and syst.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QCCSVF59/art9.html","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 6; 2016PF-022; K:mongolian Plateau; K:scenario planning; K:system dynamics model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These outputs are deployed in support of landscape planning and the decision process integrating multiple stakeholder perspectives in São Paulo state administration, the water utility company, and municipalities.","2023-01","2023-01-23 16:46:25","2023-12-07 17:40:03","2023-01-23 16:46:25","401","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www-mdpi-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RK2XJEV7/Cho et al. - 2023 - Collaborative Watershed Modeling as Stakeholder En.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; K:collaborative modeling; T:Modeling; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2023; 2018PF-042; K:stakeholder engagement; K:hydrologic simulation model; K:policy decision analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, inferences of ecological and evolutionary processes within the Caribbean may in fact represent artifacts of an unrecognized human legacy linked to issues influenced by centuries of colonial rule. The threats posed by stochastic natural and anthropogenically influenced disasters demand that we have an understanding of the natural history of endemic species if we are to halt extinctions and maintain access to traditional livelihoods. However, systematic issues have significantly biased our biological knowledge of the Caribbean. We discuss two case studies of the Caribbean’s fragmented natural history collections and the effects of differing governance by the region’s multiple nation states. We identify knowledge gaps and highlight a dire need for integrated and accessible inventorying of the Caribbean’s collections.

Open-data global databases now exist on animal migration, species distribution, conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom worldwide. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana, and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository, which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species worldwide, from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices. COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g., ecoregion, taxonomy, biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide R code to some of these examples. Synthesis: We introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, a resource for animal demography. Its open-data nature, together with its ancillary information, will facilitate comparative analysis, as will the growing availability of databases focusing on other aspects of the rich animal diversity, and tools to query and combine them. Through future frequent updates of COMADRE, and its integration with other online resources, we encourage animal ecologists to tackle global ecological and evolutionary questions with unprecedented sample size.","2016-03","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:40:03","","371–384","","2","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","171 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YJGZVY9Z/Salguero-Gómez et al. - 2016 - COMADRE a global data base of animal demography.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Year 2; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; 2016; 2012PF-003; T:Wildlife; K:matrix population model; K:animal population ecology; K:comparative approach; K:open-data; K:population growth rate (λ)","","Tim Coulson","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over 28 months of surveillance, we aimed to understand the relationships among different marine resource governance models, local people's fish catch, the consumption of seafood, and nutritional status. In the Antongil Bay, fisheries governance takes three general forms: traditional management, marine national parks, and co-management. Traditional management involves little to no involvement by the national government or non-governmental organizations, and focuses on culturally accepted Malagasy community practices. Co-management and marine national parks involve management support from either an NGO or the national government. Five communities of varying governance strategies were enrolled into the study including 225 households and 1031 individuals whose diets, resource acquisition strategies, fisheries and agricultural practices, and other social, demographic and economic indicators were measured over the span of three years. Clinical visits with each individual were conducted at two points during the study to measure disease and nutritional status. By analyzing differences in fish catch arising from variation in governance (in addition to intra-annual seasonal changes and minor inter-annual changes), the project will allow us to calculate the public health value of sustainable fisheries management approaches for local populations. There is hope that coastal zones that are managed sustainably can increase the productivity of fisheries, increasing the catch of seafood products for poor, undernourished populations.","2019-07","2020-11-17 20:34:40","2023-12-07 17:40:03","","109","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8M3TLTFK/Golden et al. - 2019 - Cohort Description of the Madagascar Health and Environmental Research–Antongil (MAHERY–Antongil) Study in Madaga.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Postdoc; Year 5; 2019; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Fisheries; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; Year 6 (JG); 2015C12-041; K:food security; K:malnutrition; K:planetary health; K:fisheries; K:health Impact Assessment; K:micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs); K:seafood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Globalization, including new access to markets, can change social-ecological, land-sea linkages via livelihood responses and adaptations by local people. As a first step in understanding these trans-ecosystem effects, we examined exit and entry decisions of artisanal fishers and smallholder farmers on the rapidly globalizing Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. We found that exit and entry decisions demonstrated clear temporal and spatial patterns and that these decisions differed by livelihood. In addition to household characteristics, livelihood exit and entry decisions were strongly affected by new access to regional and global markets. The natural resource implications of these livelihood decisions are potentially profound as they provide novel linkages and spatially-explicit feedbacks between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Our findings support the need for more scientific inquiry in understanding trans-ecosystem tradeoffs due to linked-livelihood transitions as well as the need for a trans-ecosystem approach to natural resource management and development policy in rapidly changing coastal regions.","2017-10","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:40:03","","e0186683","","10","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JV6NVX9A/Kramer et al. - 2017 - Coastal livelihood transitions under globalization.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/M9CNFXV4/article.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; 2017; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; T:Agriculture; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; Year 3; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:agricultural workers; K:agriculture; 2013T7-018; K:crops; K:roads; K:farms; K:lagoons; K:marine ecosystems; K:marine fish","","Judi Hewitt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cold-water refuges are discrete patches of relatively cool water that are used by coldwater organisms for thermal relief and short-term survival. Globally, cohesive management approaches are needed that consider interlinked physical, biological, and social factors of cold-water refuges. We review current understanding of cold-water refuges, identify gaps between science and management, and evaluate policies aimed at protecting thermally sensitive species. Existing policies include designating cold-water habitats, restricting fishing during warm periods, and implementing threshold temperature standards or guidelines. However, these policies are rare and uncoordinated across spatial scales and often do not consider input from Indigenous peoples. We propose that cold-water refuges be managed as distinct operational landscape units, which provide a social and ecological context that is relevant at the watershed scale. These operational landscape units provide the foundation for an integrated framework that links science and management by (1) mapping and characterizing cold-water refuges to prioritize management and conservation actions, (2) leveraging existing and new policies, (3) improving coordination across jurisdictions, and (4) implementing adaptive management practices across scales. Our findings show that while there are many opportunities for scientific advancement, the current state of the sciences is sufficient to inform policy and management. Our proposed framework provides a path forward for managing and protecting cold-water refuges using existing and new policies to protect coldwater organisms in the face of global change.","2023-07","2023-07-24 15:46:22","2023-12-07 17:40:02","","","","","","","Glob Chang Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 37466251","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37466251","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Climate Change; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Workshop; T:Ecology; F:Actionable Research; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Pollution; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2023; T:Coasts & Shorelines; Year 10; T:Wildlife; K:temperature; K:climate change adaptation; 2020W-101; K:behavioral thermoregulation; K:lotic ecosystem management; K:refugia; K:salmonids; K:thermal heterogeneity; K:thermal refuges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given projected sea-level rise, it is imperative to examine the extent to which farmers in coastal Bangladesh can adapt by diversifying economic activities before resorting to migration within and across borders. Here, to identify patterns in how households adapt to increased sea/freshwater flooding and soil salinity, we analyse nationally representative socioeconomic and migration data against a suite of environmental variables constructed at the sub-district level. Our results show that inundation alone has negligible effects on migration and agricultural production. However, gradual increases in soil salinity correspond to increasing diversification into aquaculture and internal migration of household members. Salinity is also found to have direct effects on internal and international migration even after controlling for income losses, with mobility restricted to certain locations within Bangladesh. Our study suggests that migration is driven, in part, by the adverse consequences of salinity on crop production.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:30:21","2023-12-07 17:40:02","","981–985","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","181 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WXRCLQ9B/Chen, Mueller - 2018 - Coastal climate change, soil salinity and human migration in Bangladesh.pdf","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; T:Agriculture; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; K:sea level rise; K:sea-level rise; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2017C16-010; K:flooding; K:salience; K:salt water intrusion; K:saltwater intrusion; K:soil salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vulnerability maps are used to direct attention to geographic areas where impacts on society are expected to be greatest and that may therefore require adaptation interventions.

This paper presents the results of a systematic review of 84 studies that map social vulnerability to climate impacts. These assessments are compiled by interdisciplinary teams of researchers, span many regions, range in scale from local to global, and vary in terms of frameworks, data, methods, and thematic foci. The goal is to identify common approaches to mapping, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and offer recommendations and future directions for the field. The systematic review finds some convergence around common frameworks developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, frequent use of linear index aggregation, and common approaches to the selection and use of climate and socioeconomic data. Further, it identifies limitations such as a lack of future climate and socioeconomic projections in many studies, insufficient characterization of uncertainty, challenges in map validation, and insufficient engagement with policy audiences for those studies that purport to be policy relevant.

Claims of regional or global knowledge about the patterns, causes, and significance of changes in social-ecological systems, or ‘generalized knowledge claims' (GKCs), are generally produced by synthesis of evidence compiled from local and regional case study observations. GKCs now constitute a wide and varied body of research, yet they are also increasingly contested based on disagreements about their geographic, temporal, and/or thematic validity. There are no accepted guidelines for detecting biases or logical gaps between GKC's and the evidence used to produce them. Here, we propose a typology of GKCs based on their evidence base and the process by which they are produced. The typology is structured by three dimensions: i) the prior state of knowledge about the phenomenon of interest; ii) the logic of generalization underlying the claim; and iii) the methodology for generalization. From this typology, we propose a standardized approach to assess the quality and commensurability of these dimensions for any given GKC, and their ability to produce robust and transparent knowledge based on constituent evidence. We then apply this approach to evaluate two contested GKCs – addressing global biodiversity and large-scale land acquisitions – and in doing so demonstrate a coherent approach to assessing and evaluating the scope and validity of GKCs. With this approach, GKCs can be produced and applied with greater transparency and accuracy, advancing the goal of actionable science on social-ecological systems.","2018-05","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:40:02","","1–14","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","86 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CC6J89WX/Magliocca et al. - 2018 - Closing global knowledge gaps Producing generaliz.pdf","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Postdoc; Year 5; C:Case Study; K:biodiversity; T:Synthesis Research; Workshop; F:Actionable Research; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014PF-012; Year 4 (JD); K:land-use change; K:meta-analysis; K:synthesis; 2016PF-022; 2015W-045; K:causal inference; Year 6 (GA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a social-ecological system (SES) framework to evaluate the possible range of changes in moose abundance, distribution, and harvesting for Nuiqsut, a small native community in northern Alaska. Our results indicate that within the area used for hunting by the village, moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) abundance has been highly variable despite recent increases in tall shrubs, which provide forage and cover for moose. Projections for moose abundance also indicate continued fluctuation in the future. Our analysis shows that future increases in moose distribution under a warming climate will not be in river systems accessible to hunters by boat. Hunter access (i.e., river navigability) also may not increase under warming. The community of Nuiqsut thus offers a case study of high exposure to an expansion of moose habitat and distribution under warming, but low sensitivity to this change because of constraints on harvesting.

To better ensure access to adequate land and water resources, many investors and countries began leasing large areas of agricultural land in the global South, a phenomenon often termed “large-scale land acquisition” (LSLA). To date, this global land rush has resulted in the appropriation of 41million hectares and about 490km3 of freshwater resources, affecting rural livelihoods and local environments. It remains unclear to what extent land and water acquisitions contribute to the emergence of water-stress conditions in acquired areas, and how these demands for water may be impacted by climate change. Here we analyze 18 African countries – 20Mha (or 80%) of LSLA for the continent – and estimate that under present climate 210km3year−1of water would be appropriated if all acquired areas were actively under production. We also find that consumptive use of irrigation water is disproportionately contributed by water-intensive biofuel crops. Using the IPCCA1B scenario, we find only small changes in green (−1.6%) and blue (+2.0%) water demand in targeted areas. With a 3°C temperature increase, crop yields are expected to decrease up to 20% with a consequent increase in the water footprint. When the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2concentrations is accounted for, crop yields increase by as much as 40% with a decrease in water footprint up to 29%. The relative importance of CO2 fertilization and warming will therefore determine water appropriations and changes in water footprint under climate change scenarios.","2016-08","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:40:01","","231–237","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GJSSXH72/Chiarelli et al. - 2016 - Climate change and large-scale land acquisitions i.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; T:Agriculture; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2016; F:Water & People; k:water resources; Fellow; K:climate change; K:biofuel crops; K:blue and green water; K:crop water requirement; K:large-scale land acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investments in education serve as an important pathway out of poverty, yet reduced agricultural productivity due to droughts or temperature shocks may affect educational attainment if children receive poorer nutrition during early childhood, are required to participate in household income generation during schooling ages, or if households can no longer pay for school-related expenses. We link longitudinal socioeconomic, demographic, and schooling data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey to high-resolution gridded climate data to measure exposure to temperature and precipitation relative to historical norms. We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to understand how climate variability impacts grade attainment and school enrollment. Results indicate that early life climatic conditions—namely milder temperatures during all seasons and greater rainfall during the summer agricultural season—are associated with an increased likelihood of a child having completed any education. In addition, greater summer rainfall during both early life and school ages is associated with having completed any schooling as well as with attending school at the time of the survey. These findings suggest that future climate change may reduce children's school participation in rural Sub-Saharan Africa, slowing progress toward human development goals and poverty alleviation.","2016-11","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:40:01","","111–123","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/32XAMX49/Randell and Gray - 2016 - Climate variability and educational attainment Ev.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; T:Education/Pedagogy; Year 6; 2016; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; K:climate variability; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:climate change; K:Ethiopia; 2016PF-026; K:educational attainment; K:schooling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, changing climate and land use are already driving geographic range shifts in wildlife, producing novel species assemblages and opportunities for viral sharing between previously isolated species. In some cases, this will inevitably facilitate spillover into humans—a possible mechanistic link between global environmental change and emerging zoonotic disease. Here, we map potential hotspots of viral sharing, using a phylogeographic model of the mammal-virus network, and projections of potential geographic range shifts for 3,139 mammal species under climate change and land use scenarios for the year 2070. Range-shifting mammal species are predicted to aggregate at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, driving the novel cross-species transmission of their viruses an estimated 4,000 times. Counter to expectations, holding warming under 2°C within the century does not reduce new viral sharing, due to greater potential range expansions— highlighting the need to invest in surveillance even in a low-warming future. Most projected viral sharing is driven by diverse hyperreservoirs (rodents and bats) and large-bodied predators (carnivores). Because of their unique dispersal capacity, bats account for the majority of novel viral sharing, and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary pathways that could facilitate future emergence in humans. Our findings highlight the urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity surveys tracking species’ range shifts, especially in tropical countries that harbor the most emerging zoonoses.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:40:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; 2020; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; T:Disease & Pests; K:viral surveillance; K:mammal virus; K:viral sharing; K:virus; preprint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes in elemental ratios may, in turn, alter the degree of stoichiometric mismatch between primary producer hosts and their pathogens. Here, we outline how ecological stoichiometry could be used as a framework to predict the effects of changing nutrient supply on stoichiometric mismatches in autotroph–pathogen interactions. We discuss empirical evidence linking pathogen performance to stoichiometric mismatches arising from shifts in elemental availability. Our synthesis indicates that fungi may be particularly sensitive to changes in N supply and viruses generally respond strongly to changes in the supply of either of these elements, but it also highlighted the need for additional data, especially for bacteria. Consequently, fungal pathogens may respond more strongly to changes in host C:N stoichiometry, whereas viruses may be highly sensitive to both changes in C:N and C:P of hosts. Additionally, our synthesis suggests that viruses may be more homeostatic than fungi, and therefore respond more strongly to changing elemental supplies. Revealing stoichiometric mismatches may greatly support our understanding of how host–pathogen interactions in primary producers will respond to changes in global biogeochemical cycles, controlling disease incidence in primary producers under scenarios of global change.","2021-04","2021-05-28 21:33:48","2023-12-07 17:40:00","2021-05-28 21:33:48","1046-1055","","7","130","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

We link census data from 29 countries across the global tropics to high-resolution gridded climate data to understand how climatic conditions experienced in utero and during early childhood affect educational attainment at ages 12 to 16. We show that exposure to higher-than-average temperatures during the prenatal and early-life period is associated with fewer years of schooling in Southeast Asia. In this region, a child who experiences temperatures 2 SDs above average is predicted to attain 1.5 fewer years of schooling than one who experiences average temperatures. In addition, early-life rainfall is positively correlated with attainment in West and Central Africa as well as Southeast Asia, and negatively correlated with attainment in Central America and the Caribbean. While we expected that children from the most educated households would be buffered from these effects, we discover that they tend to experience the greatest educational penalties when exposed to hotter early-life conditions and, in some regions, to drier conditions. For example, among the most educated households in West and Central Africa, predicted schooling is 1.8 years lower for children who experience early-life rainfall 2 SDs below average versus 2 SDs above average, while the difference is just 0.8 years for children from the least educated households.

This paper examines if proportionality or disproportionality best characterizes the production of toxic pollution in US manufacturing from 1998 to 2012. Examining U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory data from over 25,000 facilities in 322 industries, we find consistently high levels of disproportionality across facility-level toxic releases within industries, even when controlling for facility size. Moreover, high levels of within industry disproportionality are remarkably stable over the fifteen-year study period. In other words, year by year a small handful of egregiously polluting facilities account for the vast majority of toxic releases within a given industry. Our findings suggest that disproportionality should be understood as the default pattern of pollution generation rather than an exceptional case and that policymakers should seek to reduce pollution via carefully considered targeting strategies rather than broad-stroke decision making.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:30:02","2023-12-07 17:40:00","","","","6","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7DVJQ4WG/Collins et al. - 2020 - Characterizing disproportionality in facility-leve.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2020; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Pollution; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; Year 3; Fellow; wrong DBI; 2013PF-005; K:environmental pollution; K:EPA; K:pollution; K:toxic pollution; K:U.S. EPA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To safeguard treatable infections, a deliberate social-ecological transformation is needed toward stewardship of the global microbiome and long-term sustainable use of antibiotics. We review the foundation for such a transformation using recent insights from sustainability science, evolutionary biology and health, and the understanding of human interactions with microbes as two intertwined complex adaptive systems. A coherent strategy should acknowledge humans as the source of the world's strongest evolutionary force, reflect that antibiotics are building blocks of modern health systems, and strive to build social-ecological resilience to minimize levels of resistance and avoid over dependency on innovation of new drugs.

Here, the leading element is defined as the sub-system with the largest coupling coefficient averaged over a selected time span. Previously, the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) method has been employed to determine causality and dominant component in weakly coupled systems with constant coupling coefficients. In this study, CCM is applied to a pair of coupled Lorenz systems with time-varying coupling coefficients, exhibiting switching between dominant sub-systems in different periods. Four sets of numerical experiments are carried out. The first three cases consist of different coupling coefficient schemes: I) Periodic–constant, II) Normal, and III) Mixed Normal/Non-normal. In case IV, numerical experiment of cases II and III are repeated with imposed temporal uncertainties as well as additive normal noise.

Social capital theory suggests that actors in cohesive networks are positioned to build trust and mutual understanding of problems and act collectively to address these problems, and that actors engaged with diverse partners are positioned to access new information and resources that are important for innovation and complex problem solving. We investigated the patterns of interaction within a network of organizations involved in forest and wildfire management in Oregon, USA, for evidence of structural conditions that create opportunities for collective action and learning. We used descriptive statistical analysis of social network data gathered through interviews to characterize the structure of the network and exponential random graph modeling to identify key factors in the formation of network ties. We interpreted our findings through the lens of social capital theory to identify implications for the network’s capacity to engage in collective action and complex problem-solving about how to adapt to environmental change. We found that tendencies to associate with others with similar management goals, geographic emphases, and attitudes toward wildfire were strong mechanisms shaping network structure, potentially constraining interactions among organizations with diverse information and resources and limiting opportunities for learning and complex problem-solving needed for adaptation. In particular, we found that organizations with fire protection and forest restoration goals comprised distinct networks despite sharing concern about the problem of increasing wildfire risk.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:39:59","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9T27C8NJ/art23.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Resilience; 2017; K:adaptation; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 3; K:collective action; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; T:Disturbance; 2013PF-007; K:adaptive capacity; K:forests; K:governance networks; K:wildfire; K:organizational networks; K:social learning; K:social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:39:59","","665–669","","7647","543","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","556 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Research","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LYZLPNCL/nature21708.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Pursuit; Year 1; Postdoc; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Fisheries; K:marine protected areas; 2012T3-007; 2014PF-011; Year 4 (DG); K:fish population data; K:mpas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prevent illegal uses of natural resources, such as poaching endangered species, governments have advocated granting policy flexibility to local authorities by liberalizing culling or hunting of large carnivores. We present the first quantitative evaluation of the hypothesis that liberalizing culling will reduce poaching and improve population status of an endangered carnivore. We show that allowing wolf (Canis lupus) culling was substantially more likely to increase poaching than reduce it. Replicated, quasi-experimental changes in wolf policies in Wisconsin and Michigan, USA, revealed that a repeated policy signal to allow state culling triggered repeated slowdowns in wolf population growth, irrespective of the policy implementation measured as the number of wolves killed. The most likely explanation for these slowdowns was poaching and alternative explanations found no support. When the government kills a protected species, the perceived value of each individual of that species may decline; so liberalizing wolf culling may have sent a negative message about the value of wolves or acceptability of poaching. Our results suggest that granting management flexibility for endangered species to address illegal behaviour may instead promote such behaviour.","2016-05","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:39:58","","","","1830","283","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","64 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MJ5C6TVK/Chapron and Treves - 2016 - Blood does not buy goodwill allowing culling incr.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; T:Conservation; Venture; 2016; T:Policy & Regulation; 2014V-026; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:wolf; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:conservation; K:culling; K:illegal hunting; K:large carnivore; K:policy signal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If a community of interacting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to withstand small perturbations to component species' abundances without suffering adverse effects. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium point is known as the community matrix, which describes the population dynamics of interacting species. A system's asymptotic short- and long-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the community matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to describe intermediate, transient dynamics. We first recover the established result that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region of ‘transient instability', where the effect of a small perturbation to species' abundances—to the population vector—is amplified before ultimately decaying. Then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability can be affected by uncertainty in, or small changes to, entries in the community matrix, and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude of perturbations to the population vector. Of five different types of community matrix, we find that amplification is least severe when predator-prey interactions dominate. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose dynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix.","2016-06","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:39:58","","e0157876","","6","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecology; 2016PF-027; Year 6; 2016; K:stability; K:community interactions; K:jacobian matrix","","Roberto Andre Kraenkel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to data science competencies, competencies collaborating across disciplines are essential to enable sustainability scientists to work with data scientists. Programs and courses that target both sets of competencies—data science and interdisciplinary collaboration—will improve our workforce capacity to apply innovative new approaches to yield solutions to complex sustainability problems.

Two hydrological models were developed to represent the distributions of water and yields in the study watershed: HEC-HMS and SWAT. Simulation results indicate that when nature-based solutions are implemented, surface runoff is reduced and ambient storage increases during the rainy season (December–March); while the overall flow increases during the dry season (June–September). The combination of specific hydrologic components of RIOS-customized intervention scenario simulation outputs—namely surface flows and groundwater contribution to stream flows—indicate on average 33% increase in the overall water yield, or 206 hm3/year, across the study watershed when comparing against the baseline conditions. In the same modeling scenario, the water storage in the sub-watersheds adjacent to the reservoirs showed an increase of 58% (or 341 hm3/year).

Land use change researchers use a variety of land cover products to track deforestation trends, including maps they produce themselves and readily available products, such as the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. However, all land cover maps should be critically assessed for limitations and biases to accurately communicate and interpret results. In this study, we assess deforestation in PA complexes located in agricultural frontiers in the Amazon Basin. We studied three specific sites: Amboró and Carrasco National Parks in Bolivia, Jamanxim National Forest in Brazil, and Tambopata National Reserve and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park in Peru. Within and in 20km buffer areas around each complex, we generated land cover maps using composites of Landsat imagery and supervised classification, and compared deforestation trends to data from the GFC dataset. We then performed a dissimilarity analysis to explore the discrepancies between the two remote sensing products. Both the GFC and our supervised classification showed that deforestation rates were higher in the 20km buffer than inside the PAs and that Jamanxim National Forest had the highest deforestation rate of the PAs we studied. However, GFC maps showed consistently higher rates of deforestation than our maps. Through a dissimilarity analysis, we found that many of the inconsistencies between these datasets arise from different treatment of mixed pixels or different parameters in map creation (for example, GFC does not detect reforestation after 2012). We found that our maps underestimated deforestation while GFC overestimated deforestation, and that true deforestation rates likely fall between our two estimates. We encourage users to consider limitations and biases when using or interpreting our maps, which we make publicly available, and GFC’s maps.","2022-07","2022-07-15 16:40:39","2023-12-07 17:39:57","2022-07-15 16:40:39","e0268970","","7","17","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RAUEFBTX/Kinnebrew et al. - 2022 - Biases and limitations of Global Forest Change and.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NITNKPWP/article.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; 2022; K:Agricultural soil science; K:mapping; K:Brazil; K:Forests; 2018GS5-006; K:Deforestation; K:Deserts; K:Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that predator–prey dynamics should be more thoroughly considered in empirical research and disease dynamic modeling approaches in order to reveal answers to outstanding questions relating to pathogen bioaccumulation.","2021-02","2021-02-09 14:38:44","2023-12-07 17:39:57","2021-02-09 14:38:44","411-420","","5","36","","Trends in Ecology & Evolution","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Y57J6YKB/S0169534721000240.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; T:Ecology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; 2021; T:Disease & Pests; 2018PF-040; K:disease ecology; K:pathogens; K:contact behavior; K:cross-species transmission; K:epizootics; K:predation; K:spillover; K:transmission; K:zoonotic disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Societal factors such as resident preferences for tree traits, nursery offerings, and neighborhood characteristics are potentially key drivers of urban tree community composition and diversity, however, they remain critically understudied. We investigated patterns of urban tree structure in residential neighborhoods of the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, combining biological variables, such as neighborhood and plant nursery tree species and trait composition, and sociological data comprised of resident surveys and U.S. Census data. We sampled nine neighborhoods that varied in household income and age of homes. We found more tree species were offered in locally owned nurseries compared with mass merchandiser stores and yard trees at private residences were more diverse than public street trees in the same neighborhoods. There were significant differences among neighborhoods in street and yard tree composition. Newer neighborhoods differed from older neighborhoods in street tree species composition and trait diversity, while neighborhoods varying in affluence differed in yard tree composition. Species richness of yard trees was positively correlated with neighborhood household income, while species richness of street trees was negatively correlated with home age of neighborhood residences. Tree traits differed across neighborhoods of varying ages, suggesting different tree availability and preferences over time. Last, there was a positive correlation between resident preferences for tree attributes and the number of trees that had those attributes both in residential yards and in nursery offerings. Strong relationships between social variables and urban tree composition provides evidence that resident preferences and nursery offerings affect patterns of biodiversity in cities across Salt Lake Valley. These findings can be applied toward efforts to increase taxonomic and functional diversity of city trees in semiarid regions in ways that will also provide ecosystem services of most interest to residents.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:39:57","","259-276","","2","88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","108 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sociology; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; K:trees; 2015PF-018; K:urban ecosystems; K:species richness; K:arid; K:semiarid; K:urban tree structure; K:urban trees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that mean river flow and shelf slope were the most important variables, whereas population density and sediment load had a much lower importance. Deforestation and other variables related to land-use generally had a very small effect, but were more influential in a subset comprising Mediterranean and Black Sea deltas. As most deltas have developed over thousands of years, the much shorter-lived anthropogenic signals from deforestation and other landscape perturbations have had only secondary impact on the total area of deltas. Also, delta progradation is strongly influenced on sand deposition, whereas anthropogenic impacts on sediment load have more often impacted mostly the finer sediment being deposited offshore (prodelta deposits) or in the deltaic plain. These data disproves the hypothesis that delta size and growth is strongly influenced by human forcings, particularly for larger deltas, since Holocene delta building is mainly determined by natural forces. However, humans are influencing the geomorphology of deltas, particularly over the last century when the Anthropocene nature of deltas has become manifest. A more precise terminology is proposed to clarify concepts such as “human-made”, “human-engineered” or “human-influenced” deltas.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:30:27","2023-12-07 17:39:56","","24–32","","","173","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H38AX67Y/S0921818118303333.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; K:deforestation; T:Environmental History; K:land use change; K:land use; K:river basins; K:deltas; K:river deltas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hematophagous insects, such as mosquitoes (Aedes spp.), meet the criteria for venomous, and some endoparasitic insects, such as warble flies (Hypoderma tarandi), satisfy the definition for toxungenous. The impacts of these insects on their hosts are wide ranging. In the Arctic, their primary host is the most abundant ungulate, the caribou (Rangifer tarandus). The most conspicuous impacts of these insects on caribou are behavioral. Caribou increase their movements during peak insect harassment, evading and running away from these parasites. These behavioral responses scale up to physiological effects as caribou move to less productive habitats to reduce harassment which increases energetic costs due to locomotion, reduces nutrient intake due to less time spent foraging, and can lead to poorer physiological condition. Reduced physiological condition can lead to lower reproductive output and even higher mortality rates, with the potential to ultimately affect caribou demographics. Caribou affect all trophic levels in the Arctic and the processes that connect them, thus altering caribou demographics could impact the ecology of the region. Broadening the definitions of venomous and toxungenous animals to include hematophagous and endoparasitic insects should not only generate productive collaborations among toxinologists and parasitologists, but will also lead to a deeper understanding of the ecology of toxic secretions and their widespread influence.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:30:02","2023-12-07 17:39:56","","334","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: NLM (Medline)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3NAF9JBJ/Joly et al. - 2020 - Behavioral, Physiological, Demographic and Ecologi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/384B7CYP/334.html","","no acknowledgment; K:behavior; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; 2020; T:Ecology; Year 9; T:Disease & Pests; 2019PF-049; K:movement ecology; K:mosquito; K:mosquitoes; K:demographics; K:insects; K:Aedes spp.; K:caribou; K:energetics; K:Hypoderma tarandi; K:parasites; K:physiological; K:warble fly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, the relationships between biodiversity and habitat vary with spatial and biological context. In this study, we compare how well habitat geodiversity (spatial variation in abiotic processes and features) and climate explain biodiversity patterns of birds and trees. We also evaluate the consistency of biodiversity–geodiversity relationships across ecoregions. Location: Contiguous USA. Time period: 2007–2016. Taxa studied: Birds and trees. Methods: We quantified geodiversity with remotely sensed data and generated biodiversity maps from the Forest Inventory and Analysis and Breeding Bird Survey datasets. We fitted multivariate regressions to alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, accounting for spatial autocorrelation among Nature Conservancy ecoregions and relationships among taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional biodiversity. We fitted models including climate alone (temperature and precipitation), geodiversity alone (topography, soil and geology) and climate plus geodiversity. Results A combination of geodiversity and climate predictor variables fitted most forms of bird and tree biodiversity with < 10% relative error. Models using geodiversity and climate performed better for local (alpha) and regional (gamma) diversity than for turnover-based (beta) diversity. Among geodiversity predictors, variability of elevation fitted biodiversity best; interestingly, topographically diverse places tended to have higher tree diversity but lower bird diversity. Main conclusions Although climatic predictors tended to have larger individual effects than geodiversity, adding geodiversity improved climate-only models of biodiversity. Geodiversity was correlated with biodiversity more consistently than with climate across ecoregions, but models tended to have a poor fit in ecoregions held out of the training dataset. Patterns of geodiversity could help to prioritize conservation efforts within ecoregions. However, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms more fully before we can build models transferable across ecoregions.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:39:56","","696–710","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MQBTSNS8/Read et al. - 2020 - Beyond counts and averages Relating geodiversity .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NS2VYNAB/geb.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; K:biodiversity; T:Conservation; Year 8; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:climate; 2018PF-041; K:beta diversity; K:alpha diversity; K:gamma diversity; K:conservation; K:breeding bird survey; K:forest inventory; K:geodiversity","","Volker Bahn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adding ecosystem services into assessments implies measuring how much a change in ecological conditions affects people, social benefit, or value to society. Despite consensus around the general merit of accounting for ecosystem services, systematic guidance on what to measure and how is lacking. Current ecosystem services assessments often resort to biophysical proxies (e.g., area of wetland in a floodplain) or even disregard services that seem difficult to measure. Valuation, an important tool for assessing trade-offs and comparing outcomes, is also frequently omitted due to lack of data on social preferences, lack of expertise with valuation methods, or mistrust of valuation methods for non-market services. To address these shortcomings, we propose the use of a new type of indicator that explicitly reflects an ecosystem's capacity to provide benefits to society, ensuring that ecosystem services assessments measure outcomes that are demonstrably and directly relevant to human welfare. We call these Benefit-relevant indicators (BRIs) and describe a process for developing them using causal chains that link management decisions through ecological responses to effects on human well-being. BRIs identify what is valued and by whom, but stop short of valuation. A BRI for the ability of wetlands to ameliorate flooding would connect measures of the quantity and quality of wetland in a floodplain, as affected by wetlands management decisions, to the number of people or properties downstream that are vulnerable to flooding. BRIs can support monetary or non-monetary valuation, but are particularly useful when valuation will not be conducted; in such cases they serve as stand-alone measures of “what is valued” by particular beneficiaries. BRIs are valid measures of ecosystem services in that they are directly linked to human well-being. Flexibility in the development of BRIs helps to ensure that they are broadly applicable across practitioner and stakeholder communities and decision contexts.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:39:56","","1262–1272","","","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","155 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ACJ68CSY/Olander et al. - 2018 - Benefit relevant indicators Ecosystem services me.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Pursuit; T:Economics; Year 1; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Research Frameworks; K:natural capital; K:socio-ecological systems; K:indicators; K:socio-environmental systems; K:valuation; 2012T3-005; K:ecosystem service asessments; K:ecosystem service valuation; K:environmental accounting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve urban sustainability, Chinese cities need to be better designed, planned, and managed in a more ecological and sustainable way. In this study, we focused on Shenzhen City in southern China, which has experienced extremely rapid urbanization and socioeconomic transformations since China's economic reform and open-door policy enacted in 1978. We have proposed a methodology for environmental resource accounting, which consists of ecosystem services, atmospheric environment capacity, water environment resource, and land value. Our methodology recognizes the strategic significance for conserving biodiversity and maintaining high environmental quality. In particular, protecting the remaining natural and semi-natural areas in and around the city – ecological core areas – is of paramount importance. In addition to valuating urban environmental resources and services, we have also proposed an ecological network-based urban landscape design in order to improve urban sustainability for the city. Our proposed urban design plan has been taken seriously by the city government.

To address the continuing and accelerating alterations that climate change is bringing to SESs, adaptive governance generally will require more flexibility than prior governance institutions have often allowed. However, to function as good governance, adaptive governance must pay real attention to the problem of how to balance this increased need for flexibility with continuing governance stability so that it can foster adaptation to change without being perceived or experienced as perpetually destabilizing, disruptive, and unfair. Flexibility and stability serve different purposes in governance, and a variety of tools exist to strike different balances between them while still preserving the governance institution’s legitimacy among the people governed. After reviewing those purposes and the implications of climate change for environmental governance, we examine psychological insights into the structuring of adaptive governance and the variety of legal tools available to incorporate those insights into adaptive governance regimes. Because the substantive goals of governance systems will differ among specific systems, we do not purport to comment on what the normative or substantive goals of law should be. Instead, we conclude that attention to process and procedure (including participation), as well as increased use of substantive standards (instead of rules), may allow an increased level of substantive flexibility to operate with legitimacy and fairness, providing the requisite levels of psychological, social, and economic stability needed for communities to adapt successfully to the Anthropocene.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:39:55","","","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/26CS2S9T/Craig et al. - 2017 - Balancing stability and flexibility in adaptive go.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MAFV8MAN/art3.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; Pursuit; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; T:Psychology; Year 2; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:environmental law; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2013T5-006; K:law; K:adaptive governance; K:resilience; K:equity; K:balance; K:due process; K:fairness; K:legitimacy; K:nonequilibrium; K:procedure; K:rule; K:standard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicate similar development trajectories among urbanization gradients, but heterogeneity in the type and magnitude of hydrologic responses to this apparently uniform urban pattern. Similar urban patterns did not confer similar hydrologic function. Study watersheds in landscapes with level slopes and high soil permeability had less frequent high-flow events, longer high-flow durations, lower flashiness response, and lower flow maxima compared to similarly developed watersheds in landscape with steep slopes and low soil permeability. Our results suggest that physical characteristics associated with level topography and high water-storage capacity buffer the severity of hydrologic changes associated with urbanization.

Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 μg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 μg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 μg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 μg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines.","2015-03","2020-11-17 20:35:21","2023-12-07 17:39:55","","e0118748","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","124 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/79P5I3TU/Dively et al. - 2015 - Assessment of Chronic Sublethal Effects of Imidacl.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RIMXHSSM/article.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2015; T:Ecology; T:Pollution; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; K:bees; K:honey bees; K:foraging; K:diet; K:honey; K:larvae; K:pollen; K:pollinators; K:sucrose","","Nicolas Desneux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many eco-hydrological simulations, fire is included as an exogenous force. Rarely are the bidirectional feedbacks between watersheds and fire regimes integrated in a simulation system because the eco-hydrological model predicts variables that are incompatible with the requirements of fire models. WMFire is a fire-spread model of intermediate complexity designed to be integrated with the Regional Hydro-ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). Spread in WMFire is based on four variables that (i) represent known influences on fire spread: litter load, relative moisture deficit, wind direction and topographic slope, and (ii) are derived directly from RHESSys outputs. The probability that a fire spreads from pixel to pixel depends on these variables as predicted by RHESSys. We tested a partial integration between WMFire and RHESSys on the Santa Fe (New Mexico) and the HJ Andrews (Oregon State) watersheds. Model assessment showed correspondence between expected spatial patterns of spread and seasonality in both watersheds. These results demonstrate the efficacy of an approach to link eco-hydrologic model outputs with a fire spread model. Future work will develop a fire effects module in RHESSys for a fully coupled, bidirectional model.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:39:55","","706–718","","8","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P5Y3G4IB/Kennedy et al. - 2017 - Balancing uncertainty and complexity to incorporat.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YRAEX5A9/WF16169.html","","Year 4; 2017; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Modeling; T:Disturbance; K:watersheds; 2014T10-007; K:wildfire; K:HJ Andrews; K:New Mexico; K:Oregon; K:Santa Fe watershed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improving our understanding of which African vulture species could best serve as an umbrella species for the entire suite of African vultures could help conservationists save time, money, and resources by focusing their efforts on a single vulture species. Furthermore, improving our understanding of the suitability of African vultures as biomonitors for detecting environmental toxins could help conservation authorities to detect changes in ecosystem health. We used a systematic approach based on criteria selected a priori to objectively evaluate the potential of each of the 10 resident African vulture species as (i) an umbrella species for all of the African vulture species, and (ii) an avian biomonitor. For each criterion, we scored the respective African vulture species and summed the scores to determine which species was best suited as an umbrella species and as an avian biomonitor. Our results showed that, overall, certain aspects of vulture ecology (large population sizes, large body sizes, long lifespans, and their ability to be monitored over numerous seasons) support their suitability as biomonitors, while other ecological traits, including their diets and the public’s perceptions of vultures, could diminish their suitability. The White-backed Vulture (Gyps africanus) was the best fit of the 10 vulture species in our assessment as both an avian biomonitor and an umbrella species for all African vulture species. Meanwhile, significant knowledge gaps for other species inhibit their utility as biomonitors. Due to their large home-range sizes, African vultures may only be useful as biomonitors at a regional scale. However, there could be value in using the White-backed Vulture as an umbrella species, as an aid to conserve the entire suite of African vulture species.","2021-11","2022-01-04 17:19:55","2023-12-07 17:39:54","","","","","2","","Frontiers in Conservation Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VA96E58F/Krueger et al. - 2021 - Assessing African Vultures as Biomonitors and Umbr.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meredith-Gore/publication/356533487_Assessing_African_Vultures_as_Biomonitors_and_Umbrella_Species/links/61a176b26b9a6f0967084390/Assessing-African-Vultures-as-Biomonitors-and-Umbrella-Species.pdf","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Biodiversity; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 6; T:Policy & Regulation; 2021; 2016C15-005; Adaptive governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The habitat of thousands of imperiled wildlife species occurs in a variety of land management regimes (e.g., protected areas, multiple-use areas), each exerting differing effects. We used the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) to examine the relationships between habitat change and land management in Nepal's Chitwan district, a global biodiversity hotspot. We evaluated the effects of environmental and human factors on tiger habitat based on data acquired by motion-detecting cameras and space-borne imaging sensors. Spatiotemporal habitat dynamics in Chitwan National Park and a multiple-use area outside the park were then evaluated in three time periods (1989, 1999, and 2009). Our results indicate that tigers preferred areas with more grasslands and higher landscape connectivity. The area of highly suitable habitat decreased inside the park over the entire 20 year interval, while outside the park habitat suitability increased, especially from 1999 to 2009. The loss of highly suitable habitat inside the park may be associated with an increasing trend of unauthorized resource extraction by a rapidly growing human population, coupled with natural processes such as flooding and forest succession. In contrast, community-based management of natural resources and the prohibition of livestock grazing since the late 1990s likely improved tiger habitat suitability outside the park. Results of this study are useful for evaluating habitat change and guiding conservation actions across the tiger range, which spans 13 countries. Moreover, quantitatively assessing habitat change across different land management regimes in human-dominated areas provides insights for conserving habitat of other imperiled wildlife species around the world.","2013-10","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:39:54","","1-19","","10","4","","","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISBN: 2150-8925 Publisher: Ecological Society of America","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VSZPQGMU/Carter et al. - 2013 - Assessing spatiotemporal changes in tiger habitat .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SA89NTVS/ES13-00191.html","","no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 3; K:protected areas; 2013PF-009; K:Panthera tigris; K:tiger; K:tigers; K:habitat change; 2013; K:camera trap; K:community-based management; K:land change; K:land management; K:N-mixture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have examined these losses, but the causes of the Antillean Late Quaternary vertebrate extinctions, and especially the role of humans, are still unclear. Previous results provide support for climate-related and human-induced extinctions, but often downplaying other complex bio-ecological factors that are difficult to model or to detect from the fossil and archaeological record. Here, we discuss Caribbean vertebrate extinctions and the potential role of humans derived from new and existing fossil and archaeological data from Cuba. Our results indicate that losses of Cuba’s native fauna occurred in waves: one during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, a second during the middle Holocene, and a third one during the last 2 ka, combining the arrival of agroceramists and later of Europeans. The coexistence of now-extinct species with multiple cultural groups in Cuba for over 4 ka implies that Cuban indigenous non-ceramic cultures exerted far fewer extinction pressures to native fauna than the later agroceramists and Europeans that followed. This suggests a determinant value to increased technological sophistication and demographics as plausible effective extinction drivers. Beyond looking at dates of first human arrival alone, future studies should also consider cultural diversity with attention to different bio-ecological factors that influence these biodiversity changes.","2020-12","2020-11-17 20:29:59","2023-12-07 17:39:54","","106597","","","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IEQM7CY9/S027737912030559X.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; K:biodiversity; Year 8; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Disturbance; K:Caribbean; T:Environmental History; K:Holocene; K:extinction; 2018C18-007; K:anthropogenic factors; K:chronology; K:Cuba; K:Extirpation; K:islands; K:vertebrates; K:West Indies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda includes a goal to reduce FLW by 50% by 2030. Given differences in resource inputs along the food supply chain (FSC), the environmental benefits of FLW reduction will vary by stage of the FSC. Here, we identify the points along the supply chain where a 50% FLW reduction could yield the largest potential environmental benefits, assuming that decreases in consumption propagate back up the supply chain to reduce production. We use an environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) model combined with data on rates of FLW to calculate the scale of the total environmental impacts of the U.S. food system resulting from lost or wasted food. We evaluate the maximum potential environmental benefit resulting from 50% FLW reduction at all possible combinations of six supply chain stages (agricultural production, food processing, distribution/retail, restaurant foodservice, institutional foodservice, and households). We find that FLW reduction efforts should target the foodservice (restaurant) sector, food processing sector, and household consumption. Halving FLW in the foodservice sector has the highest potential to reduce greenhouse gas output and energy use. Halving FLW in the food processing sector could reduce the most land use and eutrophication potential, and reducing household consumption waste could avert the most water consumption. In contrast, FLW reduction at the retail, institutional foodservice, and farm level averts less environmental impact. Our findings may help determine optimal investment in FLW reduction strategies.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:30:05","2023-12-07 17:39:54","","","","","712","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","100 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GUY64BVZ/Read et al. - 2020 - Assessing the environmental impacts of halving foo.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; Foundation; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2020; Year 6; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; Year 6 (JG); 2017F-010; 2018PF-041; Year 8 (QR); K:decision making; K:food loss; K:food loss and waste; K:food waste; K:Environmentally extended input-output model; K:Food supply chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined how authors of these studies approached mixed methods research by coding key methodological characteristics, including relationships between method objectives, extent of integration, iterative interactions between methods, and justification for use of mixed methods. Using these characteristics, we created a typology with the goal of improving understanding of how researchers studying land-change science and environmental management approach inter- disciplinary mixed methods research. We identified 5 types of mixed methods approaches, which we termed simple nested, informed nested, simple parallel, unidirectional synthesis, and bidirectional synthesis. Methods and data sources were often used to address different research questions within a project, and only around half of the reviewed papers methodologically integrated different forms of data. Most authors used one method to inform the other, rather than both informing one another. Very few articles used methodological iteration. Each methodological type has certain epistemological implications, such as the disciplinary reach of the research and the capacity for knowledge creation through the exchange of information between distinct methodologies. To exemplify a research design that can lead to multidimensional knowledge production, we provide a methodological framework that bidirectionally integrates and iterates qualitative and quantitative methods.","2020-09","2021-05-28 19:46:22","2023-12-07 17:39:53","2021-05-28 19:46:22","130-141","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MJHJPXTT/Kinnebrew et al. - 2021 - Approaches to interdisciplinary mixed methods rese.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DZBN4CJJ/cobi.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NFFWNPA5/cobi.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; reported to NSF; Year 8; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2020; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; K:mixed methods; K:mixed methods approach; 2018GS5-006; K:land change; K:data relationships; K:environmnetal management; K:integration; K:iteration; K:mixed methods approaches; K:qualitative and quantitative methods; K:quantiative and qualitative methods; K:socio-environmental research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collaborative solutions are required because air pollution is difficult to monitor completely top-down, and effective coordination requires shared decision making. To understand the root causes of this dilemma, and identify potential policy solutions, we interviewed key stakeholders and collected background information about the case. We used Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to understand the factors and political/economic dynamics that have created the current problem. We analyze this dilemma using Ostrom’s design principles for co-production, and related concepts of state-reinforced self-governance. We find significant gaps in co-production. Grassroots, neighborhood-level monitoring is not integrated with or legitimized by formal government agencies. Communication among key stakeholders is infrequent, and decision making is primarily top-down, giving residents little control over pollution in their neighborhoods. Costs and benefits of monitoring and enforcement are not shared equitably among the key actors, and there are low levels of trust. These gaps may be remedied by policies that empower residents to formally monitor air pollution in their neighborhoods, greater representation of residents on the pollution control district board, and collaborative programs that facilitate shared decision making among key actors.","2021-05","2021-03-08 14:13:41","2023-12-07 17:39:53","2021-03-08 14:13:41","105383","","","104","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VZXYYYYW/Sarr et al. - 2021 - Applying Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Devel.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4ZBCNBJ7/Sarr et al. - 2021 - Applying Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Devel.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/94BIKVXR/S026483772100106X.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W4GPHNIQ/S026483772100106X.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Sustainability; reported to NSF; Year 8; K:public participation; F:Actionable Research; T:Pollution; F:Vulnerability & Risk; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2021; K:institutional analysis; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Research Frameworks; 2018C18-009; K:environmental justice; K:monitoring; K:Ostrom; K:State-reinforced self-governance; K:co-production; K:air pollution; K:air quality regulation; K:institutional analysis and design framework; K:Ostrom’s IAD framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fossil fuels have an additional water footprint that is not easily accounted for: ancient water that was used by plants millions of years ago, before they were transformed into fossil fuel. How much water is mankind using from the past to sustain current energy needs? We evaluate the link between ancient water virtually embodied in fossil fuels to current global energy demands by determining the water demand required to replace fossil fuels with biomass produced with water from the present. Using equal energy units of wood, bioethanol, and biodiesel to replace coal, natural gas, and crude oil, respectively, the resulting water demand is 7.39 × 1013 m3y−1, approximately the same as the total annual evaporation from all land masses and transpiration from all terrestrial vegetation. Thus, there are strong hydrologic constraints to a reliance on biofuel energy produced with water from the present because the conversion from fossil fuels to biofuels would have a disproportionate and unsustainable impact on the modern water. By using fossil fuels to meet today's energy needs, we are virtually using water from a geological past. The water cycle is insufficient to sustain the production of the fuel presently consumed by human societies. Thus, non-fuel based renewable energy sources are needed to decrease mankind's reliance on fossil fuel energy without placing an overwhelming pressure on global freshwater resources.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:39:53","","515-519","","5","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/E47JAEXZ/D'Odorico et al. - 2017 - Ancient water supports today's energy needs.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MT4GZEJP/2017EF000544.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; Year 6; F:Water & People; 2016PF-029; T:Environmental History; K:water footprint; K:virtual water; K:water cycle; K:ancient water; K:energy; K:energy use; K:fossil fuels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As ecosystems progress through recovery, it is important to estimate any resulting deficit in biodiversity and functions. Here we use data from 3,035 sampling plots worldwide, to quantify the interim reduction of biodiversity and functions occurring during the recovery process (that is, the ‘recovery debt'). Compared with reference levels, recovering ecosystems run annual deficits of 46–51% for organism abundance, 27–33% for species diversity, 32–42% for carbon cycling and 31–41% for nitrogen cycling. Our results are consistent across biomes but not across degrading factors. Our results suggest that recovering and restored ecosystems have less abundance, diversity and cycling of carbon and nitrogen than ‘undisturbed' ecosystems, and that even if complete recovery is reached, an interim recovery debt will accumulate. Under such circumstances, increasing the quantity of less-functional ecosystems through ecological restoration and offsetting are inadequate alternatives to ecosystem protection.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:39:53","","1416","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","200 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LMZTHD4X/Moreno-Mateos et al. - 2017 - Anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance and the recove.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RP52ZJUF/ncomms14163.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Pursuit; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Year 3; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; T:Disturbance; K:nitrogen; K:carbon; 2013T7-015; K:nitrogen cycling; K:carbon cycling; K:ecological restoration; K:ecosystem recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on adaptation of water governance in river basins, the study finds 21 reappearing patterns. Less well-established patterns relate to water property rights, hydrological standards, adaptation externalities, non-climatological uncertainty and vertical coordination.

Relatively little work in agricultural adoption has explicitly examined the multilevel dynamics of adoption decision-making. Yet because many SMPs involve cooperative dilemmas—they are individually costly but provide group benefits—understanding the dynamics of both individual and group level behavioral change is critical. In this paper, we argue that cultural evolutionary theory is well suited to examining the emergence and spread of cooperative SMPs, and we illustrate this claim by applying a cultural multilevel selection (CMLS) framework to the adoption of SMPs on the part of winegrape growers in California, USA. Using survey data from over 800 winegrape growers in 3 regions, we estimate the individual-level costs and group-level benefits of 44 different SMPs. We then relate this to variation in their adoption within and between winegrape growing regions to characterize the scope for cultural group selection of the various practices. We also identify a number of mechanisms that might plausibly explain the observed patterns of variation, including various forms of cultural group selection. We highlight the added value of this perspective with respect to the established approaches and outline the data requirements for researchers to conduct similar studies in other settings. Our results underscore the potential for a cultural evolutionary perspective to shed light on the multiscale mechanisms driving adoption of SMPs and, more generally, the promise of cultural evolutionary approaches to supplement existing analytical toolkits in sustainability science.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:39:53","","71-80","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Japan","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HVDRGZPI/Hillis et al. - 2018 - Applying a cultural multilevel selection framework.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Agriculture; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Venture; Year 3; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2014V-028; K:cultural evolution; K:California; K:decision making; K:sustainable management practices; K:cultural multilevel selection; K:viticulture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Differences in catchment area, soil water storage, management practices, tree species, and climate are among the many explanations proposed for heterogeneous hydrologic responses. We addressed evidence for the hypothesis that mean annual temperature (MAT) and the phase shift between precipitation and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) peaks, θ, explain a significant amount of the variation in hydrologic response to forest cover loss. We selected 50 catchments with daily streamflow records spanning eight nations and seven climate regions. Categorical clustering of catchments was performed with MAT, θ, minimum EVI, catchment area, and percentage forest loss. Similar storm event runoff ratio responses to deforestation were best clustered by MAT and θ. High MAT tropical monsoonal catchments (Brazil, Myanmar, and Liberia) exhibited minimal evidence of increasing runoff ratios (increases observed in 9% of catchments). Low MAT subarctic, cold semi-arid, and humid continental catchments (US, Canada, and Estonia) showed consistent runoff increases around the time of snowmelt (94%). The deforestation runoff responses of temperate and subtropical catchments with Mediterranean, humid, and oceanic climates depended strongly on θ. We observe increased runoff following forest loss in a majority of catchments (90%) where precipitation peaks followed peak growing season (max EVI) (US). In contrast, where precipitation peaks preceded the growing season (South Africa and Australia) there was less evidence of increased runoff (25% of catchments). This research supports the strategic implementation of native forest conservation or restoration for simultaneously mitigating the effects of global climate change and regional or local surface runoff.","2020-10","2021-06-01 00:34:14","2023-12-07 17:39:52","2021-06-01 00:34:14","104051","","10","15","","Environ.

Thus, we argue that a clearly articulated and comprehensive set of social standards - a code of conduct - is needed to guide marine conservation. In this paper, we draw on the results of an expert meeting and scoping review to present key principles that might be taken into account in a code of conduct, to propose a draft set of foundational elements for inclusion in a code of conduct, to discuss the benefits and challenges of such a document, and to propose next steps to develop and facilitate the uptake of a broadly applicable code of conduct within the marine conservation community. The objectives of developing such a code of conduct are to promote fair conservation governance and decision-making, socially just conservation actions and outcomes, and accountable conservation practitioners and organizations. The uptake and implementation of a code of conduct would enable marine conservation to be both socially acceptable and ecologically effective, thereby contributing to a truly sustainable ocean.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:39:52","","411–418","","","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","80 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4CL234KC/Bennett et al. - 2017 - An appeal for a code of conduct for marine conserv.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P68D4RGP/an-appeal-for-a-code-of-conduct-for-marine-conservation.html","","Year 4; 2017; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Conservation; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:environmental governance; K:socio-environmental systems; 2014PF-011; K:conservation planning; K:marine conservation; K:code of conduct; K:conservation governance; K:conservation social science; K:environmental management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet it remains a challenge to generalize across case studies to produce knowledge at broader regional and global scales even as the effort to do so, mostly using metastudy methods, has accelerated. One major obstacle is that the geographic context of case study knowledge is often presented in a vague and incomplete form, making it difficult to reuse and link with the regional and global contexts within which it was produced and is therefore most relevant. Here we assess the degree to which the quality of geographic description in published land change case studies limits their effective reuse in spatially explicit global and regional syntheses based on 437 spatially bounded cases derived from 261 case studies used in published land change metastudies. Common ambiguities in published representations of case geographic contexts were identified and scored using three indicators of geographic data quality for reuse in spatially explicit regional and global metastudy research. Statistically significant differences in the quality of case geographic descriptions were evident among the six major disciplinary categories examined, with the earth and planetary sciences evidencing greater clarity and conformance scores than other disciplines. The quality of case geography reporting showed no statistically significant improvement over the past fifty years. By following a few simple and readily implemented guidelines, case geographic context reporting could be radically improved, enabling more effective case study reuse in regional to global synthesis research, thereby yielding substantial benefits to both case study and synthesis researchers.","2016-05","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:39:52","","572–596","","3","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Routledge","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/D8YWBWBZ/Margulies et al. - 2016 - Ambiguous Geographies Connecting Case Study Knowl.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QDCRPTAC/24694452.2016.html","","no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; C:Case Study; F:Support for Teaching & Training; T:Education/Pedagogy; T:Synthesis Research; 2016; Fellow; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:case study; K:scale; K:land change; K:case studies; K:geographic representation; K:GIScience; K:metastudies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite recent focus on the geographical distribution of viruses and bacteria, the overall environmental distribution of human pathogens and parasites on Earth remains incompletely understood. As islands have long inspired basic ecological insights, we aimed to assess whether the microorganisms that cause human disease in modern times follow patterns common to insular plants and animals. Location: Global and regional. Methods: Relying on the publically accessible GIDEON database, we use the spatial distribution of nearly 300 human parasites and pathogens across 66 island countries and territories to assess the current predictive value of the ‘equilibrium theory’ of island biogeography. The relationships between species richness and (1) island surface area and (2) distance to the nearest mainland were investigated with linear regression, and ANCOVAs were used to test for differences in these relationships with respect to pathogen ecology and taxonomy. Results: Pathogen species richness increases with island surface area and decreases with distance to the nearest mainland. The effect of area is more than 10 times lower than that usually reported for macroorganisms, but is greater than the effect of distance. The strongest relationships are for pathogens that are vector-borne, zoonotic (with humans as dead-end hosts) or protozoan. Main conclusion: Our results support the basic predictions of the theory: disease diversity is a positive function of island area and a negative function of island isolation. However, differences in the effects of area, distance and pathogen ecology suggest that globalization, probably through human travel and the animal trade, has softened these relationships. Parasites that primarily target non-human species, whose distributions are more constrained by island life than are those restricted to human hosts, drive the island biogeography of human disease.","2015-11","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:39:52","","107–116","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3XPGCBYV/Jean et al. - 2016 - An equilibrium theory signature in the island biog.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VEB67XLC/geb.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2015; Year 2; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; T:Disease & Pests; K:disease ecology; 2012PF-004; K:human health; K:pathogen diversity; K:species–area relationship; K:parasites; K:islands; K:infectious diseases; K:island biogeography; K:pathogen biogeography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This requires recovery of organisms along with the ecosystem features and dynamic processes that support them. Since self-sustainability is the goal, it also requires a landscape and environmental context that supports recovery of the system. As restoration becomes more widely practiced, so too are many specialized forms of environmental intervention, such as those associated with reducing the impacts of development, promoting recovery of endangered species, and achieving compensatory mitigation. These may be valuable and may also be informed by ecological science but they differ substantially from ecological restoration because they are not necessarily focused on recovery of a self-sustaining living system characteristic of past or least-disturbed landscapes. The U.S. legal system has failed to make this distinction. Federal statutes do not explicitly define restoration and in fact do little to constrain or even guide this process; if this is not rectified, net ecological losses will continue to occur. Scientists and policy makers can add precision to the use and practice of ecological restoration and other, more specialized forms of restoration, to ensure a future that can support ecosystems and the people that depend on them.","2015-11","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:39:52","","512–519","","9","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Ecological Society of America","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/U7K67HMG/Palmer and Ruhl - 2015 - Aligning restoration science and the law to sustai.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P467L9UY/150053.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2015; Foundation; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Actionable Research; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:environmental law; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; K:law; 2014F-008; K:interventions; K:restoration; K:ecological restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes occurring prior to insect introductions remain poorly understood. We used a unique dataset of 1,902,392 border interception records from inspections at air, land and maritime ports in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Japan, the United States of America and Canada to identify key commodities associated with insect movement through trade and travel. A total of 8,939 species were intercepted, and commodity association data were available for 1,242 species recorded between 1960 and 2019. We used rarefaction and extrapolation methods to estimate the total species richness and diversity associated with different commodity types. Plant and wood products were the main commodities associated with insect movement across cargo, passenger baggage and international mail. Furthermore, certain species were mainly associated with specific commodities within these, and other broad categories. More closely related species tended to share similar commodity associations, but this occurred largely at the genus level rather than within orders or families. These similarities within genera can potentially inform pathway management of new alien species. Combining interception records across regions provides a unique window into the unintentional movement of insects, and provides valuable information on establishment risks associated with different commodity types and pathways.","2022-08","2022-08-11 14:31:31","2023-12-07 17:39:51","2022-08-11 14:31:31","e2721","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eap.2721","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PT33FPKN/Fenn-Moltu et al. - Alien insect dispersal mediated by the global move.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZA9C4JDH/eap.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; Year 7; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Risk; 2022; T:Disease & Pests; F:Research Frameworks; 2017C17-011; K:insects; K:Commodity trade; K:globalization; K:human-mediated dispersal; K:introduction pathways; K:invasion risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This problem has spurred increased interest in the potential of small-scale agroforestry systems to couple sustainable agriculture with biodiversity conservation, particularly in rapidly developing areas of the tropics. In addition to providing natural resources (i.e. food, medicine, lumber), agroforestry systems have the potential to maintain higher levels of biodiversity and greater biomass than lower diversity crop or pasture systems. Greater plant diversity may also enhance soil quality, further supporting agricultural productivity in nutrient-limited tropical systems. Yet, the nature of these relationships remains equivocal. To better understand how different land use strategies impact ecosystem services, we characterized the relationships between plant diversity (including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity), and soil quality within pasture, agroforests, and secondary forests, three common land use types maintained by small-scale farmers in the Pearl Lagoon Basin, Nicaragua. The area is undergoing accelerated globalization following the 2007 completion of the region’s first major road; a change which is expected to increase forest conversion for agriculture. However, farmer agrobiodiversity maintenance in the Basin was previously found to be positively correlated with affiliation to local agricultural NGOs through the maintenance of agroforestry systems, despite these farmers residing in the communities closest to the new road, highlighting the potential for maintaining diverse agroforestry agricultural strategies despite heightened globalization pressures. We found that agroforestry sites tended to have higher surface soil %C, %N, and pH relative to neighboring to secondary forest, while maintaining comparable plant diversity. In contrast, pasture reduced species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity. No significant relationships were found between plant diversity and the soil properties assessed; however higher species richness and phylodiversity was positively correlated with natural resource diversity. These finding suggest that small, diversified agroforestry systems may be a viable strategy for promoting both social and ecological functions in eastern Nicaragua and other rapidly developing areas of the tropics.","2016-09","2020-11-17 20:35:26","2023-12-07 17:39:51","2021-11-29 18:45:57","e0162529","","9","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","40 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/52TVD8BD/Sistla et al. - 2016 - Agroforestry Practices Promote Biodiversity and Na.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9QAILMVE/Sistla et al. - 2016 - Agroforestry Practices Promote Biodiversity and Na.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XURWTKXE/Sistla et al. - 2016 - Agroforestry Practices Promote Biodiversity and Na.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V7WJ8RFN/article.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/597VTEBK/article.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9UY7L6ZH/article.html","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; K:biodiversity; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2016; Year 3; K:forest ecology; 2013T7-018; K:Agricultural soil science; K:Agroforests; K:forests; K:land use; K:Natural resources; K:species diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, a lack of standardization in defining how conservation actions support recovery objectives can impede action efficacy and inhibit the efficient allocation of resources across species and projects. It is especially difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of actions in U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) recovery plans due to variation in how actions are described across different plans. To address this issue, we examined our ability to apply the internationally supported Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) taxonomy to categorize existing ESA recovery plan action descriptions. Using ESA listed species in Arizona as a case study, we tested the feasibility of assigning CMP taxonomy categories to actions detailed in current recovery plans, and then used our assigned categories to assess the distribution of action categories. Pairs of researchers categorized and then compared levels of agreement between categories of recovery actions for 840 actions across 31 active recovery plans. Paired categorizations diverged for many of these actions, though confidence in action description assignments among pairs was highest in categorizing Research and Monitoring actions, which represented, on average, 53% (SD 0.9%) of actions with researcher agreement, and, on average, 42% (SD 0.08%) of classification among individual researchers. These results suggests that categorizable action descriptions most often correspond with Research and Monitoring objectives, and that other categories of actions required to delist species may be underrepresented in ESA recovery plans.

Yet, what is known about the drivers of agrobiodiversity erosion largely comes from research from communities in which farming is the principal natural resource-based livelihood. Focusing on Caribbean Nicaragua's Pearl Lagoon Basin following the construction of the first regional road, we used a mixed methods approach to understand how the complex livelihood dynamics inherent in coastal socio-ecological systems—where households rely upon both terrestrial and aquatic resources—affect farmers' decisions to maintain agrobiodiversity. Our analyses reveal atypical spatial patterns of agrobiodiversity maintenance relative to road access: the farming systems of households most proximal to the road are significantly more agrobiodiverse than those maintained by household in distant communities. This pattern is in part explained by local livelihood dynamics. Market access associated with road development encouraged the depletion of the lagoon fishery. To buffer their food security, households' near to the road are focusing efforts on their historically biodiverse subsistence agricultural systems. These findings suggest that conservation efforts targeting coastal socio-ecological systems must account for the ways in which the complexity of natural resource-based livelihoods in these systems affect households' responses to a changing world.","2019-01","2020-11-17 20:34:46","2023-12-07 17:39:51","","111-120","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer US","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QGR7X2HN/Williams, Kramer - 2019 - Agricultural Biodiversity Maintenance in a Coastal Socio-Ecological System the Pearl Lagoon Basin, Nicaragua.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A44FS33C/Williams and Kramer - 2019 - Agricultural Biodiversity Maintenance in a Coastal.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Agriculture; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Year 3; T:Fisheries; K:mixed methods; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:livelihoods; 2013T7-018; K:globalization; K:agricultural biodiversity; K:Caribbean Nicaragua; K:coastal socio-ecological systems; K:livelihood diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Encouraging small farmers across the developing world to grow more staple crops more intensively may have unintended negative consequences on dietary quality.

Objectives: Our objective was to assess how important components of biodiversity changed with different land covers, and to uncover whether particular landscapes could simultaneously deliver high agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. Methods: In agriculture-forest mosaics of Southern Ethiopia, we assessed tree and bird biodiversity using detrended correspondence analyses and binomial generalized linear mixed effects models in four zones differing in cropland, grassland, and tree cover as well as agricultural production (crop, livestock feed and fuel). Results: Tree and bird communities differed along gradients of cropland, grassland, and tree cover, implying that different species benefit from different types of land management. Bird species with smaller ranges were most abundant in the agricultural zone with highest tree cover, exceeding that of even the forest zone, and demonstrating the value of complex mosaics for conservation. The agricultural zone with the highest tree cover also had the highest total productivity in terms of crop, feed, and fuel, perhaps supported in part by ecosystem services provided by invertebrate-eating birds and trees. Conclusions: Our results challenge current paradigms of agricultural intensification and biodiversity conservation in human dominated landscapes and point to the possibility of achieving both in multifunctional landscapes. Our work also highlights the importance of considering measures of agricultural productivity beyond mere crop yields when assessing the performance of multifunctional landscapes.","2019-01","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:39:51","","341-356","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISBN: 1098001900770","","","","no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; K:biodiversity; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:trees; K:Africa; K:land cover; K:agricultural production; K:biodiversity conservation; K:land use; K:land sharing; K:land sparing; K:birds; 2016C14-021; K:multi-functional landscapes; K:agricultural intensification; K:ecological intensification; K:landscape approach; K:landscape mosaics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By applying our framework to analyze these bright spots in the United States, Brazil, and Malawi, we identify two distinct pathways—network and institutional—to diversification. These pathways emerge through alignment of factors related to social and ecological structure (policies, institutions, and environmental conditions) and agency (values, collective action, and management decisions). We find that, when network and institutional pathways operate in tandem, the potential to scale up diversification across farms and landscapes increases substantially.","2023-03","2023-03-30 14:21:25","2023-12-07 17:39:50","2023-03-30 14:21:25","","","","","","One Earth","Against the odds","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/899N9AB7/Blesh et al. - 2023 - Against the odds Network and institutional pathwa.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2JNRZRRU/S259033222300101X.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:policy; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; F:Case study collection; 2023; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:Food security; K:social-ecological systems; F:Research Frameworks; K:conceptual framework; K:transitions; 2018C19-018; K:diversified farming system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a conceptual framework that expands the Industrial→Sanitary→Sustainable City transition to include non-sanitary cities, “new cities”, and various permutations of transition options for cities encountering exogenous and endogenous “triggers of change”. When investigating and modeling these urban transitions, we should consider: (1) the triggers that have induced change; (2) situations where crisis triggers change; (3) why cities transition toward more sustainable states on their own, in the absence of crisis; (4) what we can learn from new city transitions, and non-sanitary city transitions; and (5) how resource interactions affect urban transitions. Several existing theoretical frameworks, including sustainability, resilience, adaptation, and vulnerability, may be helpful when considering urban transitions. We suggest that all of these theories interact through inertia in urban systems, and that this multi-faceted inertia—e.g. institutional inertia, infrastructural inertia, and social inertia—imparts degrees of rigidity that make urban systems less flexible and nimble when facing transitional triggers and change. Given this, solutions to urban sustainability challenges may be categorized as those: (1) that “tweak” the current systems and work with or even take advantage of the inertia in those systems, versus; (2) that are more “transformative”, that confront systemic inertia, and that may require new systems. We propose that a model for addressing urban sustainability in the context of relevant theory, and for bridging research and practice, should focus on intercity comparisons. And one mechanism to facilitate this approach is a newly formed interdisciplinary Research Coordination Network (RCN) that focuses on urban sustainability by integrating urban research while incubating solutions-oriented products and collaborative partnerships with practitioners. The Network includes more than two dozen cities in five continents that are in various degrees of transition. In the true vein of sustainability science, our Network activities are incubating societally-relevant solutions through projects that will lead to tangible, “on the ground” sustainable solutions for all types of cities. Our ultimate goal is to understand the process by which cities become more sustainable while affecting that process through action inspired by knowledge.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:30","2023-12-07 17:39:50","","320–328","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","177 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V29JU3KH/Childers et al. - 2014 - Advancing urban sustainability theory and action .pdf","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; K:adaptation; T:Sustainability; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Actionable Research; 2014; K:resilience; K:urban ecology; K:urban ecosystems; K:transitions; K:vulnerability; K:urban sustainability; 2012T1-011; K:ecology for cities; K:inertia; K:sanitary city; K:sustainable cities; K:sustainable city; K:urban transitions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, soil C reservoirs in restored wetlands are slow to accumulate even after hydrology and plant communities are reestablished. Oftentimes wetland restoration changes the soil matrix and thus can dramatically alter how soil C is stored and processed. Our research investigated whether soil organic matter (SOM) preservation theories derived from studies in non-wetland soil systems can be extended to wetland soils. We examined C associated with water-stable soil aggregates, minerals, and metal oxides within habitats of one natu-ral and one restored tidal freshwater wetland. This study revealed that a majority of the soil C in the natural site was associated with large macroag-gregates (>2000um), and soils from the restored site stored more C in small macroaggregates (≥250 to <2000 um). Despite these different associations, the chemical composition of SOM followed similar patterns across each aggregate-size class. Results from the sequential extraction procedure suggest organo-metal oxide complexes do not contribute to C stabilization in these habitats. This research is one of the few studies that have examined C stabilization related to soil structure in wetland soils. Our results suggest soil aggregate formation may be an important mechanism driving C stabilization, and that disruption to macroaggregates may limit C accumulation in restored wetlands. Additional empirical research and long-term field monitoring are needed to confirm linkages between aggregate-C stabilization and accumulation in wetland soils.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:30:17","2023-12-07 17:39:50","","252–265","","1","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Place: Madison, WI Publisher: The Soil Science Society of America, Inc.","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/C4E2MQNB/Maietta et al. - 2019 - Aggregation but Not Organo-Metal Complexes Contributed to C Storage in Tidal Freshwater Wetland Soils.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/N3I7BKYD/sssaj2018.05.html","","Staff; no acknowledgment; 2019; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:wetlands; K:carbon; K:wetland restoration; K:soil organic matter; K:wetland soils","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rather than adding more variables, progress requires a clearer, more consistent approach to selecting, defining and measuring institutional elements; stronger links between theory and empirical research; a greater focus on mechanisms and causality; and the development and application of new methods, including quantitative approaches. Strengthening the connections between theory, models, and data suggests several promising avenues for advancing institutional analysis through the study of relationships between institutional structure, process, function, context, and outcomes.","2020-06","2020-11-17 20:30:03","2023-12-07 17:39:50","","26–34","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8Q8K2DHQ/S1877343520300129.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2020; Year 7; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:institutional analysis; F:Research Frameworks; 2017C16-003; K:Ostrom; K:Social-ecological systems framework; K:socio-environmental systems framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behavior, and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production- and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the “demand” areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups, and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities that take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:34:42","2023-12-07 17:39:50","","114–125","","","213","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NW5JY4E4/Schröder et al. - 2019 - Advancing sustainable consumption and production i.pdf","","2018; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; C:Case Study; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Workshop; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; F:Research Frameworks; K:interdisciplinary; K:stakeholder engagement; K:case studies; 2016W-066; K:sustainable consumption; K:sustainable consumption and production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assertion of Native American water rights on highly developed water systems in North America has triggered governance innovations that resemble certain aspects of adaptive governance, and have emerged to accommodate the need for Indigenous water development and restoration of cultural and ecological resources. Similar innovations are observed in the assertion of Indigenous voices in Australia. This presents an opportunity to analyze the emergence of adaptive processes within complex legal systems. We explore the role of law in locally driven innovation in this context, concluding that any system of governance that requires greater flexibility will only be viewed as legitimate, and thus succeed, if attention is given not only to adaptive capacity, but also to aspects of good governance.

Resulting knowledge gaps can be barriers to governance. This research examines three case studies in which international river basin organizations, tasked with facilitating cooperation in transboundary river basins, recognized and addressed knowledge gaps to support governance of shared waters. We synthesize across the three case studies to develop a typology of knowledge gaps and the strategies used to address those gaps. In identifying common types of knowledge gaps and the on-the-ground strategies used to fill them, this research provides an important framework for assessing and theorizing knowledge at the transboundary scale, as well as useful recommendations and examples for practitioners seeking to develop that knowledge.","2020-09","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:39:49","","102162","","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/35P9UW2A/Milman et al. - 2020 - Addressing knowledge gaps for transboundary enviro.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; C:Case Study; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; Year 6; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Research Frameworks; K:transboundary; K:environmental governance; K:case study; K:Science policy interface; K:science-policy interface; 2016C15-006; K:case studies; K:international river basin organizations; K:knowledge gaps; K:transboundary water agreements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensive work has focused on natural resource responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north, while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change, constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may represent effective adaptation strategies.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:34:50","2023-12-07 17:39:49","","93-103","","1","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SR2B7CV2/Young et al. - 2018 - Adaptation strategies of coastal fishing communities as species shift poleward.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Y7QE4G7Q/Young et al. - 2019 - Adaptation strategies of coastal fishing communiti.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W4AW6DNX/5199399.html","","2018; Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Year 4; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Fisheries; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; K:coastal populations; K:fishing; K:fishing communities; 2014T9-010; K:coastal communities; K:resource users","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an asset, it occupies a unique position at the intersection of the System of National Accounts (SNA), the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF), and (as a spatial unit) SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA), making land a natural starting point for developing natural capital accounts more generally. We develop a pilot set of national and subnational land accounts for the United States that are consistent with the SEEA-CF and SNA principles, quantified in both physical and monetary terms. The physical accounts utilize detailed land use (National Land Use Database) and land cover (National Land Cover Database) datasets, which provide insights into how land cover in the United States is changing over time. To provide aggregate estimates of land values, we use a hedonic approach that exploits fine-grain microdata (“big data” from Zillow) that contains detailed information from hundreds of millions of property transactions and their corresponding physical characteristics covering much of the United States. Methodologically, we show that it is feasible to produce monetary accounts for land that can be directly linked to and integrated with physical land cover/use. Overall, U.S. land cover has shown declines in forests, cropland, and pasture with increases in barren, scrub/shrub, and developed classes, which are particularly concentrated in the U.S. Southeast. Nominal land values in the U.S. fell about 28% ($7 trillion) from the boom to bust periods in the prior decade, albeit with substantial regional variation, and have subsequently experienced a nearly full recovery in recent years. We estimate private land in the contiguous 48 states to be worth approximately $25.1 trillion in 2016.","2020-12","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2023-12-07 17:39:48","","101178","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7VH39GT8/Wentland et al. - 2020 - Accounting for land in the United States Integrat.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Human Geography; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2020; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 6; 2016C14-003; K:land use and land cover change; K:land-use change; K:land use change; K:natural capital; K:big data; K:land cover; K:land use; K:Land cover change; K:valuation; K:Environmental-economic accounting; K:Hedonic valuation; K:Land valuation; K:land-change cover; K:land-use/land-cover change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ecological and evolutionary consequences of introduced species derive from their effects on networks of species interactions, but we lack a quantitative understanding of the impacts of introduced species on ecological networks and their biogeographic patterns globally. Here we address this data gap by analysing mutualistic seed-dispersal interactions from 410 local networks, encompassing 24,455 unique pairwise interactions between 1,631 animal and 3,208 plant species. We show that species introductions reduce biogeographic compartmentalization of the global meta-network, in which nodes are species and links are interactions observed within any local network. This homogenizing effect extends across spatial scales, decreasing beta diversity among local networks and modularity within networks. The prevalence of introduced interactions is directly related to human environmental modifications and is accelerating, having increased sevenfold over the past 75 years. These dynamics alter the coevolutionary environments that mutualists experience, and we find that introduced species disproportionately interact with other introduced species. These processes are likely to amplify biotic homogenization in future ecosystems and may reduce the resilience of ecosystems by allowing perturbations to propagate more quickly and exposing disparate ecosystems to similar drivers. Our results highlight the importance of managing the increasing homogenization of ecological complexity.","2020-09","2020-11-17 20:29:59","2023-12-07 17:39:48","","74–78","","","585","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","56 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Research PMID: 32879498","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LJXRSQDG/Fricke and Svenning - 2020 - Accelerating homogenization of the global plant–fr.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/R4GKIAW3/s41586-020-2640-y.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; 2020; T:Ecology; K:ecosystem functions; K:biodiversity loss; 2018PF-037; K:seed dispersal; K:biodiversity and ecosystem function; K:introduced species; K:species homogenization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This popular model — co-production — has advanced thinking on how to create usable knowledge. In practice, however, co-production has not been a single approach, but instead a diversity of forms of engaged research.

An integrated social-ecological systems perspective is purported to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between humans and nature. Despite a threefold increase in the amount of social-ecological research published between 2010 and 2015, it is unclear whether these approaches have been truly integrative. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the conceptual, methodological, disciplinary, and functional aspects of social-ecological integration. In general, we found that overall integration is still lacking in social-ecological research. Some social variables deemed important for addressing sustainability challenges are underrepresented in social-ecological studies, e.g., culture, politics, and power. Disciplines such as ecology, urban studies, and geography are better integrated than others, e.g., sociology, biology, and public administration. In addition to ecology and urban studies, biodiversity conservation plays a key brokerage role in integrating other disciplines into social-ecological research. Studies founded on systems theory have the highest rates of integration. Highly integrative studies combine different types of tools, involve stakeholders at appropriate stages, and tend to deliver practical recommendations. Better social-ecological integration must underpin sustainability science. To achieve this potential, future social-ecological research will require greater attention to the following: the interdisciplinary composition of project teams, strategic stakeholder involvement, application of multiple tools, incorporation of both social and ecological variables, consideration of bidirectional relationships between variables, and identification of implications and articulation of clear policy recommendations.","2018-09","2020-11-17 20:34:55","2023-12-07 17:39:48","","38","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","59 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XQ8DVKVQ/Guerrero et al. - 2018 - Achieving the promise of integration in social-ecological research a review and prospectus.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/R6UMDCDE/Guerrero et al. - 2018 - Achieving the promise of integration in social-eco.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/U9TRFT8I/art38.html","","2018; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; T:Team Science & Collaborations; F:Science of Team Science; K:social-ecological systems; 2013PF-009; K:interdisciplinary; 2014PF-011; Year 4 (DG); K:socio-environmental; Year 3 (NC); K:sustainability science; K:human-environment systems; K:integrated approach; K:stakeholder participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For migratory species, in particular, it is also essential to consider the extent of spatial synchrony among separate breeding populations in range-wide predictions. We develop a quantitative method to evaluate the accuracy of climate-based ecological predictions and use this approach to assess the extent of spatio-temporal synchrony among distinct regions within the breeding range of a single migratory population. Location We model weekly site-specific summer abundances (1996–2011) of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in the Midwestern USA as a function of climate conditions experienced during a shared spring migration/breeding phase in Texas and separate summer recruitment periods in Ohio and Illinois. Methods Using negative binomial regression models, we evaluate spatio-temporal synchrony between monarchs in the two states and develop a novel quantitative assessment approach to determine the temporal predictive strength of our model with Bayesian P-values. Results Monarchs breeding in the Midwest exhibit spatio-temporal synchrony in Ohio and Illinois; cooler spring temperatures, average to above average precipitation in Texas and cooler than average summer temperatures are associated with higher population abundances in both states. At least 10 years of data are needed for adequate model predictability of average future counts. Because annual spring weather conditions in Texas primarily drive yearly abundances, as opposed to localized summer effects, year-specific counts are often difficult to predict reliably, specifically when predictive spring conditions are outside the range of typical regional conditions. Main conclusions Our assessment method can be used in similar analyses to more confidently interpret ecological responses to climate change. Our results demonstrate the relative importance of climatic drivers in predicting abundances of a migratory species and the difficulties in producing reliable predictions of animal populations in the face of climate change.","2016-08","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:40:24","","1000–1012","","8","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CM7G7GDR/Saunders et al. - 2016 - Evaluating confidence in climate-based predictions.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FVFCYVNK/geb.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Year 1; T:Climate Change; T:Conservation; Workshop; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; 2016; K:prediction; T:Vulnerability; Fellow; 2012W-002; K:Danaus plexippus; K:monarch butterflies; K:forecasting; K:migratory; K:negative binomial model; K:spatial synchrony","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We developed a new metric, the absolute wealth estimate, based on the rank of each surveyed household according to its material assets and the assumed shape of the distribution of wealth among surveyed households. Using data from 156 demographic and health surveys in 66 countries, we calculated absolute wealth estimates for households. We validated the method by comparing the proportion of households defined as poor using our estimates with published World Bank poverty headcounts. We also compared the accuracy of absolute versus relative wealth estimates for the prediction of anthropometric measures. Findings The median absolute wealth estimates of 1 403 186 households were 2056 international dollars per capita (interquartile range: 723–6103). The proportion of poor households based on absolute wealth estimates were strongly correlated with World Bank estimates of populations living on less than 2.00 United States dollars per capita per day (R2=0.84). Absolute wealth estimates were better predictors of anthropometric measures than relative wealth indexes.

While wetland area has been well documented across many landscapes and used to guide restoration efforts, few studies have directly quantified the associated wetland storage capacity. Here, we present a novel raster-based approach to quantify both contemporary and potential (i.e., restorable) storage capacities of individual depressional basins across landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of this method by applying it to the Delmarva Peninsula, a region punctuated by both depressional wetlands and drainage ditches. Across the entire peninsula, we estimated that restoration (i.e., plugging ditches) could increase storage capacity by 83%. Focusing on an individual watershed, we found that over 59% of restorable storage capacity occurs within 20 m of the drainage network, and that 93% occurs within 1 m elevation of the drainage network. Our demonstration highlights widespread ditching in this landscape, spatial patterns of both contemporary and potential storage capacities, and clear opportunities for hydrologic restoration. In Delmarva and more broadly, our novel approach can inform targeted landscape-scale conservation and restoration efforts to optimize hydrologically mediated wetland functions.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:40:24","","305-313","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V7EE926K/Jones et al. - 2018 - Estimating restorable wetland water storage at lan.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RJS5PSHU/hyp.html","","2017; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Actionable Research; F:Water & People; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017PF-034; K:hydrology; K:remote sensing; K:Restoration; K:water storage capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores the land-water-energy-food nexus in relation to large-scale farmland investments pursued by investors from European countries. The analysis is based on a “resource assessment approach” which evaluates the linkages between land acquisitions for agricultural (including both energy and food production) and forestry purposes, and the availability of land and water in the target countries. To that end, the water appropriated by agricultural and forestry productions is quantitatively assessed and its impact on water resource availability is analysed. The analysis is meant to provide useful information to investors from EU countries and policy makers on aspects of resource acquisition, scarcity, and access to promote responsible land investments in the target countries.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:40:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RW9GKCQB/Siciliano et al. - 2017 - European large-scale farmland investments and the .pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Economics; T:Agriculture; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Fellow; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:virtual water; K:Resource scarcity; K:Farmland; K:Water use; K:Trade; K:Food-energy-water nexus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we assess the multi-dimensional changes in fossil-fuel-based energy demand resulting from this agrarian transition. We focus on LSLAs by comparing two scenarios of low-input and high-input agricultural practices, exemplifying systems of production in place before and after the agrarian transition. A shift to high-input crop production requires industrial fertilizer application, mechanization of farming practices and irrigation, which increases by ~5 times fossil-fuel-based energy consumption compared to low-input agriculture. Given the high energy and carbon footprints of LSLAs and concerns over local energy access, our analysis highlights the need for an approach that prioritizes local resource access and incorporates energy-intensity analyses in land use governance.","2021-04","2022-10-18 20:26:55","2023-12-07 17:40:23","2022-10-18 20:26:55","2319","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LCCC7TKZ/Rosa et al. - 2021 - Energy implications of the 21st century agrarian t.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/K8MLDE7Q/s41467-021-22581-7.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2021; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Environmental History; K:Environmental impact; 2018C18-010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The review reflects critically on successes and failures of governance approaches, and addresses how far emerging challenges to water security reflect the expanding complexity of problems, greater connectivity of issues, multiple spatial scales, and increasing uncertainty, as well as a lack of adequate governance capacity.

The environmental flows concept has continued to evolve in response to these challenges. However, the field is characterized by a limited transferability of insights, due to the prevalence of specific case-study analyses and a lack of research on the governance of environmental flows. Building on recent advances in environmental flow science, water governance and management, we identify a clear need for a more systematic approach to the determination of environmental flow requirements (EFRs) on both the natural and social science fronts and, in particular, on the interaction between social/political and environmental systems. We suggest a framework that details as to how these advances and interactions can be achieved. The framework supports scientific analysis and practical implementation of EFRs involving systematic compilation, sharing and evaluation of experiences from different riverine ecosystems and governance systems around the globe. The concept of ecosystem services is introduced into the framework to raise awareness for the importance of ecosystem functions for the resilience of social-ecological systems, to support negotiation of trade-offs and development of strategies for adaptive implementation. Experience in implementation of environmental flow policies reveals the need for an engaged, transdisciplinary research approach where research is closely linked to implementation initiatives on the ground.

Significant associations between climate factors and vector-borne diseases have enabled predictive models to be developed that can be used in early warning systems to forecast and anticipate disease epidemics. Malaria is one such vector-borne disease, with a global distribution and significant health burden that is highly sensitive to climatic factors. Additionally, malaria is experiencing a resurgence in transmission, threatening elimination efforts. Malaria is also sensitive to non-climatic factors, such as land-use change, political instability, insecticide resistance and the effectiveness of public health control interventions. A greater understanding of the relative role of climate and non-climate factors in driving malaria transmission is needed to develop predictive models, particularly under future global change scenarios. Methods & Materials: In this study, a 20-year dataset of monthly malaria cases was used to develop a spatiotemporal Bayesian modelling framework for evaluating the relative influences of climatic and non-climatic drivers of malaria incidence in El Oro province in southern Ecuador, an area historically endemic for Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. Between the 1980s and early 2000s, El Oro experienced a surge in malaria transmission and through an effective binational collaboration became effectively malaria free in 2011. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of malaria in the region. Results: The mixed model with the best fit included the climatic variables minimum temperature and precipitation. The addition of non-climate factors, including political instability and the addition of malaria intervention activities in El Oro were also included in this model. By interacting the climate covariates with malaria intervention periods, we found the association between climate and malaria risk changed significantly following the interventions. Conclusion: Distinct variation in spatially explicit random effects was found, which suggest that other environmental factors, such as land use change or area-specific intervention efforts should be explored to understand this variation. This study demonstrates that both environmental, socio-economic and political factors should be considered when developing predictive disease models, to understand the potential environmental suitability for re-emergence in the region, given a lapse in control efforts or periods of civil unrest.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:30:03","2023-12-07 17:40:23","","28–29","","","79","","","","","","","","Elsevier BV","Vienna","","","","","","","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISSN: 12019712","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A34JS3RU/Fletcher et al. - 2019 - Environmental change and malaria risk in El Oro Province, Ecuador.pdf","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; 2019; Year 7; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:land use change; K:disease ecology; 2017C17-012; K:Malaria; K:vectorborne pathogens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One reason for this [among many (3)] is a shortfall in funding, raising a conundrum for agencies responsible for species recovery: Should resources be allocated toward species facing imminent extinction or species whose long-term survival can most benefit from investment? Some argue that the latter strategy is ethically unsound because it may abandon species with little hope of long-term recovery [for example, (4)], even when science suggests that the former strategy may miss opportunities to prevent species from ever experiencing the risk of imminent extinction (2). We suggest that framing recovery prioritization as a resource allocation problem provides a structure to facilitate constructive debate about such important questions. We discuss here the merits of an explicit resource allocation framework and introduce a prototype decision tool [(5); see supplementary materials for details] that we developed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to facilitate transparent and efficient recovery allocation decisions.","2018-10","2020-11-17 20:34:54","2023-12-07 17:40:23","","284–286","","6412","362","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science PMID: 30337394","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IJVGGNW7/Gerber et al. - 2018 - Endangered species recovery A resource allocation problem.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/G9MDBN34/Gerber et al. - 2018 - Endangered species recovery A resource allocation.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EDQ428WU/tab-pdf.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30337394","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Year 4; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Venture; F:Actionable Research; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:species recovery; K:decision support tools; 2015V-035; K:Endangered Species Act","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a plan’s outcomes for marine environments and coastal communities may be of particular interest, these results cannot be separated from planning processes. The field has yet to fully develop the guidance necessary for this critical consideration of how features of an MSP process and external factors interact with plan performance and outcomes. To fill this gap we used a literature review and expert discussions to identify 19 enabling or disabling conditions of MSP within four major categories: Plan Attributes, Legal Context, Plan Development and Social Context, and Integration. We propose semi-quantitative scoring and the development of narratives to operationalize the framework as part of a comprehensive methodology for MSP outcome evaluation. Applying the framework can add depth to quantitative MSP evaluation, shed light on questions of outcome attribution, and inform plan adaptation. Evaluating MSP outcomes in the explicit context of the enabling or disabling conditions identified here can stimulate discussion around what works in MSP and provide a path forward for assessing the benefits and costs of MSP worldwide. By identifying conditions instrumental to effective MSP, and alternatively, conditions hindering a plan, the framework can be used to guide plan adaptation and promote learning across the wider MSP community.","2022-06","2022-06-13 19:38:29","2023-12-07 17:40:22","2022-06-13 19:38:29","105141","","","143","","Marine Policy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TJ7GMAQF/Zuercher et al. - 2022 - Enabling conditions for effective marine spatial p.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/M7VHIRLJ/S0308597X22001889.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2022; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Research Frameworks; Year X; K:adaptive management; 2020PF-050; K:Marine spatial planning; K:MSP evaluation; K:Ecosystem-based MSP; K:Enabling conditions; K:Planning process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For indigenous communities, land is sacred and typically is used for sustainable subsistence. But these communities are increasingly threatened by illegal mining, livestock, and monoculture practices. Brazilian satellite images show 64% more deforestation in 2020 than in 2019. This promotes conflict and environmental degradation, exacerbates health risks for indigenous populations, and leads to loss of ecosystem at local, regional, and global scales. The Amazon region is at a critical moment of history. Action to protect the health and wellbeing of traditional communities, promote sustainable development, and protect forest habitat will not come from governments. How can the medical, public health, environmental, and policy communities engage effectively to tackle such a complex challenge? We consider this question with a focus on arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The emergence and expansion of these arboviral diseases is an important global threat. They are transmitted to humans by females of two resilient mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

Current theoretical conceptualizations of adaptive governance represent a series of structures and processes best suited for either adapting or transforming existing environmental governance regimes towards forms flexible enough to confront rapid ecological change. As the number of empirical examples of adaptive governance described in the literature grows, the conceptual basis of adaptive governance remains largely under theorized. We argue that reconnecting adaptive governance with foundational concepts of ecological resilience—specifically Panarchy and the adaptive cycle of complex systems—highlights the importance of episodic disturbances and cross–scale interactions in triggering reorganizations in governance. By envisioning the processes of adaptive governance through the lens of Panarchy, scholars and practitioners alike will be better able to identify the emergence of adaptive governance, as well as take advantage of opportunities to institutionalize this type of governance in pursuit of sustainability outcomes. The synergistic analysis of adaptive governance and Panarchy can provide critical insight for analyzing the role of social dynamics during oscillating periods of stability and instability in social-ecological systems. A deeper understanding of the potential for cross–scale interactions to shape adaptive governance regimes may be useful as society faces the challenge of mitigating the impacts of global environmental change.","2016-01","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:40:22","","81–87","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","122 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3QNEEB3U/Chaffin and Gunderson - 2016 - Emergence, institutionalization and renewal Rhyth.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; Year 2; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2016; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2013T5-006; K:Environmental governance; K:Adaptive governance; K:Adaptive management; K:Panarchy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Models in disease ecology rarely track organisms past death, yet death from infection can alter important ecosystem processes including elemental recycling rates and nutrient supply to living hosts. In contrast, models in ecosystem ecology rarely track disease dynamics, yet elemental nutrient pools (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) can regulate important disease processes including pathogen reproduction and transmission. Thus, both disease and ecosystem ecology stand to grow as fields by exploring questions that arise at their intersection. However, we currently lack a framework explicitly linking these disciplines. We developed a stoichiometric model using elemental currencies to track primary producer biomass (carbon) in vegetation and soil pools, and to track prevalence and the basic reproduction number (R0) of a directly transmitted pathogen. This model, parameterised for a deciduous forest, demonstrates that anthropogenic nutrient supply can interact with disease to qualitatively alter both ecosystem and disease dynamics. Using this element-focused approach, we identify knowledge gaps and generate predictions about the impact of anthropogenic nutrient supply rates on infectious disease and feedbacks to ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling.","2020-10","2020-11-17 20:29:59","2023-12-07 17:40:22","","6-19","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZLB2A649/Borer et al. - 2020 - Elements of disease in a changing world modelling.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TV63IAQD/Borer et al. - 2021 - Elements of disease in a changing world modelling.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2020; Year 7; T:Ecology; T:Vulnerability; K:ecosystem functions; T:Disease & Pests; K:nitrogen; 2018PF-040; Year 8 (LW); 2017C17-033; K:carbon; K:Coupled element cycles; K:Droop model; K:feedback; K:infected; K:mineralisation; K:nutrient recycling; K:pathogen transmission; K:stoichiometric model; K:susceptible","","John Drake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding how sharing risk information within a human community alters the spatial dynamics of human-wildlife interactions has important implications for the design and implementation of effective conservation actions. We developed an agent-based model that simulates farmer livelihood decisions and activities in an agricultural landscape shared with a population of a generic wildlife species (wildlife-human interactions in shared landscapes [WHISL]). In the model, based on risk perception and economic information, farmers decide how much labor to allocate to farming and whether and where to exclude wildlife from their farms (e.g., through fencing, trenches, or vegetation thinning). In scenarios where the risk perception of farmers was strongly influenced by other farmers, exclusion of wildlife was widespread, resulting in decreased quality of wildlife habitat and frequency of wildlife damages across the landscape. When economic losses from encounters with wildlife were high, perception of risk increased and led to highly synchronous behaviors by farmers in space and time. Interactions between wildlife and farmers sometimes led to a spillover effect of wildlife damage displaced from socially and spatially connected communities to less connected neighboring farms. The WHISL model is a useful conservation-planning tool because it provides a test bed for theories and predictions about human-wildlife dynamics across a range of different agricultural landscapes.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:40:22","","903-914","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8HKYQFQN/Carter et al. - 2020 - Emergent conservation outcomes of shared risk perc.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/J5QIZ5Q7/cobi.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; 2020; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; T:Vulnerability; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Fellow; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:social networks; 2013PF-009; K:Agent-based models; 2013PF-008; Year 3 (ABC); Year 3 (NC); K:coexistence; K:farmer decision making; K:fencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role played by biotic factors such as competition with non-CAM species in affecting CAM expression, however, remains largely understudied. This research investigated the effects of salt and water conditions on the competition between M. crystallinum and the C3 grass Bromus mollis with which it is found to coexist in California's coastal grasslands. We also investigated the extent to which CAM expression in M. crystallinum was affected by the intensity of the competition with B. mollis. We found that M. crystallinum had a competitive advantage over B. mollis in drought and saline conditions, while B. mollis exerted strong competitive effects on M. crystallinum in access to light and soil nutrients in high water conditions. This strong competitive effect even outweighed the favorable effects of salt or water additions in increasing the biomass and productivity of M. crystallinum in mixture. Regardless of salt conditions, M. crystallinum did not switch to CAM photosynthesis in response to this strong competitive effect from B. mollis. Disturbance (i.e., grass cutting) reduced the competitive pressure by B. mollis and allowed for CAM expression in M. crystallinum when it was grown mixed with B. mollis. We suggest that moderate competition with other functional groups can enhance CAM expression in M. crystallinum, thereby affecting its plasticity and ability to cope with biological stress.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:40:21","","1–11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EHRINBNQ/Yu et al. - 2017 - Effects of competition on induction of crassulacea.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Climate Change; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; Fellow; K:drought; K:competition; K:soil salinity; K:Bromus mollis; K:California's coastal grasslands; K:crassulacean acid metabolism; K:grass cutting; K:Mesembryanthemum crystallinum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment. Depending on the modeling purpose, many SES modelers also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields, they still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community. For each challenge, we outline basic steps that can be taken to surmount the underpinning barriers. Thus, the paper identifies priority research areas in SES modeling, chiefly related to progressing modeling products, processes and practices.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:30:07","2023-12-07 17:40:21","","16226","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","67 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Wageningen UR Facilitair Bedrijf","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/USEKSYZD/Elsawah et al. - 2020 - Eight grand challenges in socio-environmental syst.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; 2019; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Team Science & Collaborations; Year 7; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2017W-069; K:uncertainty; K:decision support; K:actionable science; K:socio-ecological; K:systemic change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rapid pace of declines in species diversity and ecosystem services makes generalizations imperative. Studies have attempted to make generalizations about how species with similar traits respond to urbanization, although the results of such studies are geographically idiosyncratic. Here, we present a comparative study in three U.S. cities: Fresno, California; Tucson, Arizona; and Phoenix, Arizona in an attempt to examine consistency in how urbanization affects native bird assemblages. Using presence-absence data to define regional and urban species pools, we tested for whether the urban avian assemblage is a random subset of the regional avian assemblages on the basis of both traits and phylogeny, and whether or not urbanization causes biotic homogenization among avian assemblages. We found little evidence for non-random trait shifts, with only distributions of diet guild, migratory status, and main habitat showing any significant change, and no evidence for non-random phylogenetic patterns in urban avian assemblages. We did however find some evidence for neutral processes in species' occupancy of urban habitats. Species in the urban species pools have a higher median reporting frequency than species in the regional species pools in all three cities, although this difference is statistically significant in only one city. Cluster analyses show that levels of biotic homogenization are more severe in spring than in winter. The results presented here indicate that while urban avian assemblage structure may be determined by species' traits, which may possess phylogenetic signal, simple occurrence in an urban area is likely due to random or neutral processes. The seasonality of homogenization has not to our knowledge been previously reported. We propose that the largely similar results from the three cities in this study result from structural similarities in the matrix habitats, and that the nature of matrix habitat and context of urbanization needs to be considered in future studies in order to resolve existing inconsistencies.","2019-03","2020-11-17 20:34:42","2023-12-07 17:40:21","","71","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MIG5ZN7W/Hensley et al. - 2019 - Effects of Urbanization on Native Bird Species in .pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; Year 5; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; T:Ecology; 2015PF-020; K:Urbanization; K:Biotic homogenization; K:biotic homogenisation; K:Bird - habitat association; K:Environmental filtering; K:Traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequences include impaired cognitive and physical development, and increased childhood morbidity and mortality. Previous studies suggest that exposure to forests helps alleviate micronutrient malnutrition by increasing dietary diversity. However, evidence about the effects of forests on diet diversity is scarce and mostly based on case studies with poor study design and little relevance to global policies. Furthermore, how the effects of forests on diet diversity vary between and within communities has not received due attention; though such information could point to actions needed to improve the effects of forests on nutrition. Our study aims to strengthen the evidence of the effects of exposure to forests on dietary diversity and establish how these effects vary among communities.  Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we estimated the effects of exposure to forests on Individual Diet Diversity Score (IDDS) of children younger than 5 years. Data were from the Demographic and Health Surveys from more than 43,000 rural households across 27 developing countries. We defined forest households (i.e., families with high exposure to forest) as those in communities located within 3 km of forest edges and with at least 30% of the community’s land covered by forests. Non-forest households (i.e., those without exposure to forest) are those further than 8 km from forest edges. We assessed the difference between the dietary diversity of forest households and different groups of non-forest households to provide information about effects of exposure to forests on dietary diversity. Our empirical designs strengthened the evidence by being attentive to assumptions necessary for causal interpretations. We also investigated how the effects vary with the downscaled (i.e., from a national to a community level) gross domestic product (GDP) of communities and the specific moderating effects of access to capital, such as markets, roads, and education.  Findings: Our dataset comprised 11,338 forest households and 31,673 non-forest households. We found that high exposure to forests causes children to have at least 25% greater dietary diversity than no exposure (mean IDDS of forest households 3·12 [SD 2·29] vs. mean IDDS of non-forest households 2·50 [2·05]; difference 0·62 [95% CI 0·53–0·71]). An analysis of a subset of sub-Saharan African countries showed that the effects of close proximity to forests are significantly positive in communities with GDP less than US$3 billion (with a peak difference between IDDS of forest vs non-forest of about 0·63 [95% CI 0·38–0·88] at a community GDP of $0·7 billion), non-significant in communities with GDP $3–5 billion, and significantly negative in communities with GDP greater than $5 billion. At short distances to a market (up to 62 km) and road (up to 8 km), the effect of forests on dietary diversity is significantly positive, whereas the effect becomes non-significant at larger distances. At low education levels (0–1 years of education), effects are small and non-significant, but increase steadily and become significant as the time in education increases.  Interpretation: Our results are similar to those of some nutrition-sensitive agricultural programmes. Our study establishes the relationship between exposure to forests and quality of diet, and thus strengthens the evidence for integrating forest conservation and management into portfolios of nutrition interventions. Our results also suggest that complementary measures giving households access to capital increase the nutrition sensitivity of forest-related interventions.

Traditionally, LW has been removed from streams to minimize localized flooding and increase conveyance efficiency. More recently, LW is often added to streams as a component of stream and river restoration activities. While much research has focused on the role of LW in habitat provisioning, geomorphic stability, and hydraulics at low to medium flows, we know little about the role of LW during storm events. To address this question, we investigated the role of LW on floodplain connectivity along a headwater stream in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Specifically, we conducted two artificial floods, one with and one without LW, and then utilized field measurements in conjunction with hydrodynamic modeling to quantify floodplain connectivity during the experimental floods and to characterize potential management variables for optimized restoration activities. Experimental observations show that the addition of LW increased maximum floodplain inundation extent by 34%, increased floodplain inundation depth by 33%, and decreased maximum thalweg velocity by 10%. Model results demonstrated that different placement of LW along the reach has the potential to increase floodplain flow by up to 40%, with highest flooding potential at cross sections with high longitudinal velocity and shallow depth. Additionally, model simulations show that the effects of LW on floodplain discharge decrease as storm recurrence interval increases, with no measurable impact at a recurrence interval of more than 25 years.","2018-08","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:40:21","","134–142","","","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RCAWNHUE/Keys et al. - 2018 - Effects of large wood on floodplain connectivity i.pdf","","2018; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Water & People; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017PF-034; K:Floodplains; K:HEC-RAS; K:Hydrodynamic modeling; K:Large wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has shown that this degradation is likely to lead to negative, long-term livelihood, biodiversity, and economic impacts. In view of the level of dependence of those in the developing countries on well-functioning ecosystems, already marginalised coastal populations are likely to suffer most of the costs of the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems. One policy intervention that has been touted to deliver on conservation and longer-term development goals is the continued establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). While preliminary research has shown mixed results on the effects of MPAs, some studies show, in certain contexts, positive benefits of MPAs flowing to impoverished local populations.  METHODS: Here, we used a three-step process to see if we could detect an association between creation of MPAs and particular human health outcomes. We used childhood stunting as the dependent measure of human health. We built a database of 47 992 children living less than 25 km from a marine coast in 25 developing countries. We combined socioeconomic and health data from Demographic and Health Surveys with available climate and environmental data to examine this relationship. For analysis, we first used an information-theoretic approach to examine the potential association between distance to MPA and childhood stunting, while controlling for a suite of covariates and potential confounding socioeconomic variables. Second, we used a mixed-effect logit model to test proximity to MPAs and severe stunting in children. Third, we used propensity score matching to test the treatment effect of an MPA further while controlling for the same environmental and socioeconomic factors as in the logit models.  FINDINGS: We find that the distance to MPA does show up in the top models using an information-theoretic approach. With the logit models, we find that the further from an MPA a child lives, the greater the chance a child has of being severely stunted (p<0·001). Third, we find that a significant negative effect of the treatment on severe stunting (p<0·001)—ie, proximity to an MPA reduces the incidence of severe stunting. The effect is larger for the sample living within 25 km of large MPAs.  INTERPRETATION: While much work needs to be done to uncover a potential causal link between well-functioning marine ecosystems and childhood health, our results indicate that such an examination might prove fruitful, and ultimately that marine conservation could be a key mechanism to improve the health of the millions of marginalised coastal peoples worldwide.

As a result, those desiring stronger links between scientific knowledge and action may benefit from improved understanding of what makes knowledge actionable and what actionable knowledge can and cannot do to enhance social and environmental well-being.","2020-02","2020-11-17 20:29:59","2023-12-07 17:40:20","","A1–A5","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2GQRLJYV/Arnott et al. - 2020 - Editorial overview The science of actionable know.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NYY9CAHI/S1877343520300257.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Foundation; T:Sustainability; reported to NSF; T:Synthesis Research; 2020; T:Team Science & Collaborations; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; K:interdisciplinary; 2017F-009; K:actionable science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The adoption and implementation of effective modeling practices need to be guided by a practical understanding of the variety of decisions that modelers make, and the information considered in making these choices. There is still limited documented knowledge on the modeling workflow, and the role of contextual factors in determining this workflow and which practices to employ. This paper attempts to contribute to this knowledge gap by providing systematic guidance of the modeling practices through the phases (Planning, Development, Application, and Perpetuation) and steps that comprise the modeling process, positing questions that should be addressed. Practice-focused guidance helps explain the detailed process of conducting IWRM modeling, including the role of contextual factors in shaping practices. We draw on findings from literature and the authors' collective experience to articulate what and how contextual factors play out in employing those practices. In order to accelerate our learning about how to improve IWRM modeling, the paper concludes with five key areas for future practice-related research: knowledge sharing, overcoming data limitations, informed stakeholder involvement, social equity and management of uncertainty.","2019-06","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2023-12-07 17:40:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","69 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/N79E5BG9/Badham et al. - 2019 - Effective modeling for Integrated Water Resource M.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; Pursuit; 2019; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Actionable Research; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Water & People; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:IWRM; 2015T11-029; K:Integrated modeling; K:Stakeholders; K:Social learning; K:Calibration; K:Decision making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contemporary urban development attempts to mitigate these effects by designing stormwater infrastructure to mimic predevelopment hydrology, but their performance is highly variable. This study used in situ monitoring of recently built neighbourhoods to evaluate the catchment‐scale effectiveness of landscape decentralized stormwater control measures (SCMs) in the form of street connected vegetated swales for reducing runoff volumes and flow rates relative to curb‐and‐gutter infrastructure. Effectiveness of the SCMs was quantified by monitoring runoff for 8 months at the outlets of 4 suburban catchments (0.76–5.25 ha) in Maryland, USA. Three “grey” catchments installed curb‐and‐gutter stormwater conveyances, whereas the fourth “green” catchment built parcel‐level vegetated swales. The catchment with decentralized SCMs reduced runoff, runoff ratio, and peak runoff compared with the grey infrastructure catchments. In addition, the green catchment delayed runoff, resulting in longer precipitation–runoff lag times. Runoff ratios across the monitoring period were 0.13 at the green catchment and 0.37, 0.35, and 0.18 at the 3 grey catchments. Runoff only commenced after 6 mm of precipitation at the decentralized SCM catchment, whereas runoff occurred even during the smallest events at the grey catchments. However, as precipitation magnitudes reached 20 mm, the green catchment runoff characteristics were similar to those at the grey catchments, which made up 37% of the total precipitation in only 10 of 72 events. Therefore, volume‐based reduction goals for stormwater using decentralized SCMs such as vegetated swales require additional redundant SCMs in a treatment train as source control and/or end‐of‐pipe detention to capture a larger fraction of runoff and more effectively mimic predevelopment hydrology for the relatively rare but larger precipitation events.","2018-05","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:40:20","","2346–2361","","15","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QN7NB6ER/Woznicki et al. - 2018 - Effectiveness of landscape-based green infrastruct.pdf","","2018; Staff; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; T:Engineering & Design; K:best management practices; K:stormwater management; K:green infrastructure; K:urbanization; K:Maryland; K:stormwater control measures; K:USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results suggest that re-oligotrophication is a dominant trend in rivers and estuaries of high-income countries in the last two–three decades, while in low-income countries widespread eutrophication occurs. The decline in P is well documented in hundreds of rivers of United States and the European Union, but the biotic response of rivers and estuaries besides phytoplankton decline such as trends in phytoplankton composition, changes in primary production, ecosystem shifts, cascading effects, changes in ecosystem metabolism, etc., have not been sufficiently monitored and investigated, neither the effects of N:P imbalance. N:P imbalance has significant ecological effects that need to be further investigated. There is a growing number of cases in which phytoplankton biomass have been shown to decrease due to re-oligotrophication, but the potential regime shift from phytoplankton to macrophyte dominance described in shallow lakes has been documented only in a few rivers and estuaries yet. The main reasons why regime shifts are rarely described in rivers and estuaries are, from one hand the scarcity of data on macrophyte cover trends, and from the other hand physical factors such as peak flows or high turbidity that could prevent a general spread of submerged macrophytes as observed in shallow lakes. Moreover, re-oligotrophication effects on rivers may be different compared to lakes (e.g., lower dominance of macrophytes) or estuaries (e.g., limitation of primary production by N instead of P) or may be dependent on river/estuary type. We conclude that river and estuary re-oligotrophication effects are complex, diverse and still little known, and in some cases are equivalent to those described in shallow lakes, but the regime shift is more likely to occur in mid to high-order rivers and shallow estuaries.","2022-11","2023-03-01 19:32:13","2023-12-07 17:40:19","2023-03-01 19:32:13","1248-1266","","5","29","","","Ecosystem-level effects of re-oligotrophication and N","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.16520","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/C4FGCMEL/Ibáñez et al. - 2023 - Ecosystem-level effects of re-oligotrophication an.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VWFHIVAB/gcb.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Foundation; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; T:Pollution; Year 9; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:phosphorus; K:primary producers; 2019F-015; K:cascading effects; K:chlorophyll; K:ecosystem shift; K:oligotrophication; K:running waters; K:stoichiometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate the potential avoided costs under the NbS scenario and conduct a cost–benefit analysis of the NbS scenario investments, including both water supply and carbon sequestration benefits. We estimate that the economic losses of this single drought event totaled BRL 1.6 billion. If NbS had been implemented, this cost could have been reduced by 28%. A cost–benefit analysis that includes only the water supply or both the water supply and carbon sequestration benefits indicates that the NbS scenario has a positive net present value of BRL 144 million and BRL 632 million, respectively.

Second, questions that have a local origin, but are of international interest deal with, e.g. ecosystem services, urban resilience and human health as well as planning, management and governance of urban green spaces. A research framework for studying these issues should incorporate concepts from natural and social sciences. Ecosystem services approach could form a core of such an framework also integrating the spatial dimension (landscape ecology). Comparative research at the global scale is important to increase our understanding of the variation in urban green spaces and the ecosystem services they provide.

The concept of ecological surprise is broadly applied but seldom explicitly developed in ecological literature, and ecologists can employ diverging language, frameworks, and interpretations of surprise. Here, we synthesize what ecological surprise has meant to ecologists studying these events and review the development and use of the concept in ecology. We define ecological surprise as a situation where human expectations or predictions of natural system behavior deviate from observed ecosystem behavior. This can occur when people (1) fail to anticipate change in ecosystems; (2) fail to influence ecosystem behavior as intended; or (3) discover something about an ecosystem that runs counter to accepted knowledge. We develop a conceptual model that captures the interactions between social and ecological processes that lead to these events and examine two types of drivers that contribute to surprise: underlying driving forces and proximate causes. Our definition of ecological surprise inherently acknowledges that, to be surprising, there must be human observers to the ecological occurrence who have expectations about ecosystem behavior. To explore this dimension, we draw on social science perspectives to understand the ways in which human expectations of ecosystems are influenced by social networks, heuristics, and mental models. We use a case study to demonstrate how our integrated conceptualization of ecological surprise provides a systematic way of examining these events. Our integration of these perspectives enables us to better synthesize social and ecological knowledge of these events, and encourages ecologists to critically reflect on how they, as scientists, formulate and reformulate expectations of ecosystem behavior.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:40:19","","e02005","","12","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/UM3WNNMX/Filbee-Dexter et al. - 2017 - Ecological surprise concept, synthesis, and socia.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/N4PATVJU/ecs2.html","","2014T9-005; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; K:social–ecological systems; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecology; T:Modeling; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Research Frameworks; T:Disturbance; K:ecosystem; K:discovery; K:expectations; K:social systems; K:unexpected change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, research linking environmental stressors to lake ecological resilience has traditionally focused on a few sentinel sites, hindering the study of spatially synchronous changes across large areas. Here, we studied signatures of paleolimnological resilience by tracking change in diatom community composition over the last 2000 years in four Ecuadorian Andean lakes with contrasting ecoregions. We focused on climate and anthropogenic change, and the type of biological responses that these changes induced: gradual, elastic, or threshold. We combined multivariate ordination techniques with nonlinear time-series methods (hierarchical generalized additive models) to characterize trajectories of community responses in each lake, and coherence in such trajectories across lakes. We hypothesized that remote, high-elevation lakes would exhibit synchronous trends due to their shared climatic constraints, whereas lower elevation lakes would show less synchronous trends as a consequence of human density and land-cover alteration. We found that gradual and elastic responses dominated. Threshold-type responses, or regime shifts, were only detected in the less remote lake, after a long period of gradual and elastic changes. Unexpected synchrony was observed in diatom assemblages from geographically distant and human-impacted lakes, whereas lakes under similar broad-scale environmental factors (climate and ecoregion) showed asynchronous community trajectories over time. Our results reveal a complex ecological history and indicate that Andean lakes in Ecuador can gradually adapt and recover from a myriad of disturbances, exhibiting resilience over century to millennial timescales.","2021-04","2021-06-01 00:15:19","2023-12-07 17:40:18","2021-06-01 00:15:19","","","","","","","Ecological resilience in tropical Andean lakes","","","","","","","en","© 2021 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.11747","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XJB9XAXC/Benito et al. - Ecological resilience in tropical Andean lakes A .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5JQCVABW/lno.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 8; 2018PF-044; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; 2021; T:Disturbance; T:Environmental History; K:diatoms; K:paleoecology; K:spatial synchrony; K:Moran effect; K:paleolimnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trajectory of negative effect is broadly similar around the world, but the nature and magnitude of ecological responses to urban growth differ among locations. Some heterogeneity in response arises from differences in the level of urban development and attributes of urban water management. However, the heterogeneity also may arise from variation in hydrologic, biological, and physicochemical templates that shaped stream ecosystems before urban development. We present a framework to develop hypotheses that predict how natural watershed and channel attributes in the pre-urban-development state may confer ecological resistance to urbanization. We present 6 testable hypotheses that explore the expression of such attributes under our framework: 1) greater water storage capacity mitigates hydrologic regime shifts, 2) coarse substrates and a balance between erosive forces and sediment supply buffer morphological changes, 3) naturally high ionic concentrations and pH pre-adapt biota to water-quality stress, 4) metapopulation connectivity results in retention of species richness, 5) high functional redundancy buffers trophic function from species loss, and 6) landuse history mutes or reverses the expected trajectory of eutrophication. Data from past comparative analyses support these hypotheses, but rigorous testing will require targeted investigations that account for confounding or interacting factors, such as diversity in urban infrastructure attributes. Improved understanding of the susceptibility or resistance of stream ecosystems could substantially strengthen conservation, management, and monitoring efforts in urban streams. We hope that these preliminary, conceptual hypotheses will encourage others to explore these ideas further and generate additional explanations for the heterogeneity observed in urban streams.","2016-03","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:40:18","","380–397","","1","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: University of Chicago PressChicago, IL","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Year 4; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; 2015; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; Fellow; 2014PF-013; K:urbanization; K:biodiversity and ecosystem function; K:water storage capacity; K:conductance; K:connectivity; K:ecological resistance; K:land use history; K:sediment supply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similar development patterns and management of residential ecosystems cause many characteristics of residential ecosystems to be more similar to each other across broad continental gradients than that of former native ecosystems. For instance, similar lawn management by irrigation and fertilizer applications has the potential to influence soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and processes. We evaluated the mean and variability of total soil C and N stocks, potential net N mineralization and nitrification, soil nitrite (NO2−)/nitrate (NO3−) and ammonium (NH4+) pools, microbial biomass C and N content, microbial respiration, bulk density, soil pH, and moisture content in residential lawns and native ecosystems in six metropolitan areas across a broad climatic gradient in the United States: Baltimore, MD (BAL); Boston, MA (BOS); Los Angeles, CA (LAX); Miami, FL (MIA); Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (MSP); and Phoenix, AZ (PHX). We observed evidence of higher N cycling in lawn soils, including significant increases in soil NO2−/NO3−, microbial N pools, and potential net nitrification, and significant decreases in NH4+ pools. Self-reported yard fertilizer application in the previous year was linked with increased NO2−/ NO3− content and decreases in total soil N and C content. Self-reported irrigation in the previous year was associated with decreases in potential net mineralization and potential net nitrification and with increases in bulk density and pH. Residential topsoil had higher total soil C than native topsoil, and microbial biomass C was markedly higher in residential topsoil in the two driest cities (LAX and PHX). Coefficients of variation for most biogeochemical metrics were higher in native soils than in residential soils across all cities, suggesting that residential development homogenizes soil properties and processes at the continental scale.","2022-09","2022-10-31 13:57:39","2023-12-07 17:40:17","2022-10-31 13:57:39","e4208","","9","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4208","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WGA9MQEI/Ryan et al. - 2022 - Ecological homogenization of soil properties in th.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SAAU8CVK/ecs2.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 7; T:Ecology; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2022; K:biogeochemistry; 2017PF-031; K:nitrogen; K:land-use change; K:carbon; K:Nitrate pollution; K:irrigation; K:ecological homogenization; K:fertilization; K:native soils; K:residential landscapes; K:soil chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An often overlooked aspect of land-atmosphere coupling results from vegetation controls on dust emissions and the ability of mineral aerosols to suppress precipitation. Here we first consider the case of local (endogenous) dynamics within the Sahel, whereby enhanced dust emissions resulting from a decrease in vegetation partly suppress precipitation, thereby further reducing vegetation cover. We then account for teleconnections between Sahel precipitation and exogenous (i.e., Saharan) dust emissions due to an increase in Saharan wind speed in years of above average Sahel precipitation. We find that in both cases vegetation-climate dynamics may have two stable states, one with low precipitation and high concentration of atmospheric dust and the other with high precipitation and lower levels of atmospheric dust.","2015-09","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:40:17","","7563–7571","","18","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; 2015; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Water & People; Fellow; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:dust emissions; K:precipitation; K:Saharan; K:Sahel; K:vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infestation levels have resurged across the United States in recent decades, and cities and states are debating strategies to deal with them. Here, we introduce a mathematical model to study the spread of bed bugs and predict the costs and benefits of policies aimed at controlling them. In particular, we evaluate disclosure, a policy that requires landlords to notify potential tenants of recent infestations in a unit. While disclosure aims to protect individual tenants, our results suggest that these policies also reduce infestation prevalence market-wide. Disclosure results in some initial cost to landlords but leads to significant savings in the long term.Bed bugs have reemerged in the United States and worldwide over recent decades, presenting a major challenge to both public health practitioners and housing authorities. A number of municipalities have proposed or initiated policies to stem the bed bug epidemic, but little guidance is available to evaluate them. One contentious policy is disclosure, whereby landlords are obligated to notify potential tenants of current or prior bed bug infestations. Aimed to protect tenants from leasing an infested rental unit, disclosure also creates a kind of quarantine, partially and temporarily removing infested units from the market. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the spread of bed bugs in a generalized rental market, calibrate it to parameters of bed bug dispersion and housing turnover, and use it to evaluate the costs and benefits of disclosure policies to landlords. We find disclosure to be an effective control policy to curb infestation prevalence. Over the short term (within 5 years), disclosure policies result in modest increases in cost to landlords, while over the long term, reductions of infestation prevalence lead, on average, to savings. These results are insensitive to different assumptions regarding the prevalence of infestation, rate of introduction of bed bugs from other municipalities, and the strength of the quarantine effect created by disclosure. Beyond its application to bed bugs, our model offers a framework to evaluate policies to curtail the spread of household pests and is appropriate for systems in which spillover effects result in highly nonlinear cost–benefit relationships.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:30:17","2023-12-07 17:40:17","","201814647","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2QTGKBVK/Xie et al. - 2019 - Dynamics of bed bug infestations and control under.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RNWPGG4H/tab-article-info.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833386","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 6; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2016C13-005; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; wrong DBI; K:bed bugs; K:disclosure; K:mathematical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we use gridded, daily meteorological data and county-level annual yield data to quantify meteorological drought sensitivity of US maize and soybean production from 1958 to 2007. Meteorological drought negatively affects crop yield over most US crop-producing areas, and yield is most sensitive to short-term (1–3 month) droughts during critical development periods from July to August. While meteorological drought is associated with 13% of overall yield variability, substantial spatial variability in drought effects and sensitivity exists, with central and southeastern US becoming increasingly sensitive to drought over time. Our study illustrates fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns of drought effects, highlighting where variability in crop production is most strongly associated with drought, and suggests that management strategies that buffer against short-term water stress may be most effective at sustaining long-term crop productivity.","2016-09","2020-11-17 20:35:25","2023-12-07 17:40:16","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","194 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; Year 4; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; T:Agriculture; 2016; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:drought; 2014T9-014; K:crop yield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We highlight the contradiction between the goals of these partnerships in international agricultural development, which seek to shift power dynamics and counter market exclusion, and the internal logic of these hybrid governance approaches, which reflect the tensions of market society from which they come. We present case studies from Honduras, Peru, and Mali of agricultural public-private and public-philanthropic partnerships and their constituent actors, identifying roles and relationships among actors that personify double movement negotiations within pro-poor market-oriented development. The cases highlight the implications for civil society actors of hybrid governance systems that utilize market mechanisms to address the destructive tendencies of capitalist development. We conclude that partnerships characterized by a mismatch of responsibilities and power relations among civil society and private actors generate a new type of double movement that does not generate durable institutions and that limits the impacts of the partnerships for poor farmers.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:40:16","","","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/T7URXLNU/Double-Movement-in-Hybrid-GovernanceContestations.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; 2017; T:Sociology; T:Agriculture; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:public-private partnership; K:value chains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the health production model, we tested competing hypotheses for whether treatment effects of the program complement environmental supports or substitute for environmental constraints. We studied the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) MOVE! weight management program using VA electronic heath record data (2009–2014) and a difference-in-differences design with an inverse propensity score matched comparison group.

The program effect did not vary significantly across subgroups with different walkability, park access, or fitness facility access. The MOVE! program was not sensitive to environmental context. Results did not lend support to either hypothesis that the MOVE! program complements or substitutes for a person's built environment to affect weight management outcomes.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:30:12","2023-12-07 17:40:16","","105776","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Academic Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QEDUJ8C3/Zenk et al. - 2019 - Does the built environment influence the effective.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CKQXIHUB/Zenk et al. - 2019 - Does the built environment influence the effectiveness of behavioral weight management interventions.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MFSRXACZ/S009174351930252X.html","","no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; 2019; Year 8; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2018PF-039; K:Built environment; K:Fitness facility; K:Intervention; K:Neighborhood; K:Obesity; K:Park; K:Walkability; K:Weight loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first estimate panel models of the output of milk, which is the primary farm product in our study region. We then test for effects on pasture stocking and cow productivity as possible pathways for the effect of upstream forests on milk output. Estimation results suggest that upstream forest increases the productivity of properties with small drainage areas. The effects are strongest when water is either scarce (dry season of drought years) or excessive (rainy season of flood years).

We evaluate whether aquaculture, given current patterns of production and distribution, supports the needs of poor and food-insecure populations throughout the world. We begin by identifying 41 seafood-reliant nutritionally vulnerable nations (NVNs), and ask whether aquaculture meets human nutritional demand directly via domestic production or trade, or indirectly via purchase of nutritionally rich dietary substitutes. We find that a limited number of NVNs have domestically farmed seafood, and of those, only specific aquaculture approaches (e.g. freshwater) in some locations have the potential to benefit nutritionally vulnerable populations. While assessment of aquaculture's direct contribution via trade is constrained by data limitations, we find that it is unlikely to contribute substantially to human nutrition in vulnerable groups, as most exported aquaculture consists of high-value species for international markets. We also determine that subpopulations who benefit from aquaculture profits are likely not the same subpopulations who are nutritionally vulnerable, and more research is needed to understand the impacts of aquaculture income gains. Finally, we discuss the relationship of aquaculture to existing trends in capture fisheries in NVNs, and suggest strategies to create lasting solutions to nutritional security, without exacerbating existing challenges in access to food and land resources.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:40:15","","159","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TAI5D7CN/Golden et al. - 2017 - Does Aquaculture Support the Needs of Nutritionall.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Pursuit; Postdoc; Year 5; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Actionable Research; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:Food security; 2016PF-029; Year 6 (JG); 2015C12-041; K:Planetary health; K:Seafood; K:Sustainable food systems; K:micronutrient nutrition; K:trade deficit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drying is a disturbance that occurs in aquatic ecosystems globally and can strongly influence their communities. Although the effects of drying may depend on ecosystem connectivity and the dispersal abilities of resident species, there have been no comparisons of community responses to drying between lentic and lotic ecosystems across different climates. Here, we predicted that drying would have stronger effects on aquatic communities in isolated lentic ecosystems than in dendritic lotic ecosystems, owing to the higher hydrological connectivity of the latter, and that drying would have stronger effects on passive than on active dispersers, because of the potentially higher recolonizing ability of the latter. We tested these predictions by comparing alpha diversity, phylogenetic relatedness, and beta diversity for active and passive dispersers, in both ecosystem types across five climatic regions. Drying caused greater declines in alpha diversity in lentic than in lotic ecosystems. Communities that experienced drying were more similar to one another than those of perennial sites, and this pattern was especially pronounced in lentic ecosystems. In contrast, drying did not influence the contributions of turnover and richness gradients to beta diversity. Additionally, dispersal mode did not influence community responses to drying. Relatively weaker effects of drying in lotic compared to lentic systems were likely due to the hydrological connectivity among perennial and temporary river sites, which may facilitate dispersal of organisms to escape drying and recolonize rewetted sites. Collectively, our results suggest that habitat connectivity may ameliorate (and fragmentation may worsen) the impacts of drying disturbance. This is an important finding in light of increasing drying and concomitant aquatic habitat fragmentation under global change.","2017-07","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:40:15","","e01809","","7","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/88YPNQ5A/Rosset et al. - 2017 - Do lentic and lotic communities respond similarly .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MQD69CTZ/ecs2.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; 2016PF-025; K:wetlands; K:beta diversity; K:alpha diversity; K:streams; K:disturbance; K:connectivity; K:flow intermittence; K:hydroperiod; K:macroinvertebrates; K:phylogenetic relatedness; K:ponds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use a geographically and temporally extensive data set of butterfly abundance across the state of Ohio to ask whether phenological change can be predicted from climatological data. Our focus is on growing degree days (GDD), a commonly used measure of thermal accumulation, as the mechanistic link between climate change and species phenology. We used simple calculations of median absolute error associated with GDD and an alternative predictor of phenology, ordinal date, for both first emergence and peak abundance of 13 butterfly species. We show that GDD acts as a better predictor than date for first emergence in nearly all species, and for peak abundance in more than half of all species, especially univoltine species. Species with less ecological flexibility, in particular those with greater dietary specialization, had greater predictability with GDD. The new method we develop for predicting phenology using GDD offers a simple yet effective way to predict species' responses to climate change.","2015-06","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:40:15","","1473–1479","","6","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","74 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Ecological Society of America","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FGD2V6P4/Cayton et al. - 2015 - Do growing degree days predict phenology across bu.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/L9HRAGGY/15-0131.html","","no acknowledgment; Year 1; 2015; T:Climate Change; Workshop; T:Ecology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; Fellow; 2012W-002; K:climate change; K:temperature; K:butterflies; K:insects; K:USA; K:first emergence; K:growing degree days; K:Lepidoptera; K:Ohio; K:ordinal date; K:peak abundance; K:phenology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed DOM quality and microbial bioavailability in eight first-order Coastal Plain headwater streams along a gradient of urbanization (i.e., percent watershed impervious cover); none of the streams had point source discharges. DOM quality was measured using fluorescence excitation–emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Bioavailability was assessed using biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations. Results showed that watershed impervious cover was significantly related to stream DOM composition: increasing impervious cover was associated with decreased amounts of natural humic-like DOM and enriched amounts of anthropogenic fulvic acid-like and protein-like DOM. Microbial bioavailability of DOM was greater in urbanized streams during spring and summer, and was related to decreasing proportions of humic-like DOM and increasing proportions of protein-like DOM. Increased bioavailability was associated with elevated extracellular enzyme activity of the initial microbial community supplied to samples during BDOC incubations. These findings indicate that changes in stream DOM quality due to watershed urbanization may impact stream ecosystem metabolism and ultimately the fate of organic carbon transported through fluvial systems.","2014-07","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:40:15","","7817–7824","","14","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","228 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZPNG5JL4/es501422z.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RW6TFELU/Hosen et al. - 2014 - Dissolved Organic Matter Quality and Bioavailabili.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; F:Water & People; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2014; GRA; K:land use change; K:watershed; K:dissolved organic matter; K:DOC; K:DOM; K:landscape urbanization; K:parallel factor analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impact of climate change to our near-term futures can result in adaptations that accommodate positive societal transformations if all relevant disciplines are included in the dialogue. Past sustainable practices when melded with thoughtfully deployed technologies of today and tomorrow will assist with this new ecology.

Despite the unprecedented effort deployed for NTD elimination in the past decade, their control, mainly through drug administration, remains particularly challenging: persistent poverty and repeated exposure to pathogens embedded in the environment limit the efficacy of strategies focused exclusively on human treatment or medical care. Here, we present a simple modelling framework to illustrate the relative role of ecological and socio-economic drivers of environmentally transmitted parasites and pathogens. Through the analysis of system dynamics, we show that periodic drug treatments that lead to the elimination of directly transmitted diseases may fail to do so in the case of human pathogens with an environmental reservoir. Control of environmentally transmitted diseases can be more effective when human treatment is complemented with interventions targeting the environmental reservoir of the pathogen. We present mechanisms through which the environment can influence the dynamics of poverty via disease feedbacks. For illustration, we present the case studies of Buruli ulcer and schistosomiasis, two devastating waterborne NTDs for which control is particularly challenging.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:40:14","","","","1722","372","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","68 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GQH4INJD/Garchitorena et al. - 2017 - Disease ecology, health and the environment a fra.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438917","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; no acknowledgment; Year 2; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Venture; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2012V-009; K:environment; K:poverty; K:planetary health; K:conservation of Natural Resources; K:coupled ecological–economic systems; K:environmentally transmitted diseases; K:global Health; K:humans; K:neglected Diseases; K:sustainable disease control; K:tropical Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, when assessing the impacts of urbanization on streamflow, these factors are rarely taken simultaneously into consideration. There is thus an emerging need for approaches that allow disentangling the hydrological impacts of land cover change from those due to climate, in the context of long-term, historical changes in urban landscapes. This is here termed flow regime attribution. We demonstrate in this study the ability of a stochastic mechanistic model to perform flow regime attribution. The modeling approach is applied to the Watts Branch watershed, located in metropolitan Washington D.C., United States. To carry out the flow regime attribution, the model is used to compute streamflow indicators of hydrological alteration and perform parameter sensitivity analysis. The application of the model shows that in Watts Branch urban growth drives the long-term temporal trend in streamflow. The mean and variance of streamflow increase at the end of the gauging period by 2 and 7 times, respectively, their value relative to an only climate (no urban growth) scenario. The results show that climate mainly amplifies or dampens the temporal trend according to wet/dry variations in annual rainfall. Further, the model facilitates the attribution process by allowing the derivation of streamflow indicators that directly depend on the model parameters. The proposed modeling approach may be useful for assessing the long-term flow behavior of urban watersheds, and informing sustainable urban development decisions.","2018-09","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:40:14","","160–170","","","177","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; F:Water & People; K:stormwater management; K:hydrology; K:climate change; K:land cover; K:urban planning; 2017PF-035; K:environmental flows; K:ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research into environmentally induced migration suggests that relationship is much more complicated than originally posited by the ‘environmental refugee' hypothesis. Climate change is likely to increase migration in some cases and reduce it in others, and these movements will more often be temporary and short term than permanent and long term. However, few large-sample studies have examined the evolution of temporary migration under changing environmental conditions. To address this gap, we measure the extent to which temperature, precipitation, and flooding can predict temporary migration in Matlab, Bangladesh. Our analysis incorporates high-frequency demographic surveillance data, a discrete time event history approach, and a range of sociodemographic and contextual controls. This approach reveals that temporary migration declines immediately after flooding but quickly returns to normal. In contrast, high temperatures have sustained positive effects on temporary migration that persist over one to two year periods, while migrations decrease during extended periods of extreme precipitation. Building on previous studies of long-term migration, these results challenge the common assumption that flooding, precipitation extremes, and high temperatures will consistently increase temporary migration. Instead, our results are consistent with a livelihoods interpretation in which long-standing household livelihood strategies (both temporary migration and agriculture) are disrupted by environmental variability.","2017-09","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:40:14","","157–165","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","90 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FIAS5UF3/Call et al. - 2017 - Disruption, not displacement Environmental variab.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; Year 7; 2017PF-033; K:livelihoods; K:environment; K:population mobility; K:temporary migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GI is conceptualized to improve water and ecosystem quality by reducing storm water runoff at the source, but when properly designed, may also benefit these expanded goals. With the increasing use of GI in urban contexts, there is an emerging need to facilitate participatory design and scenario evaluation to enable better communication between GI designers and groups impacted by these designs. Major barriers to this type of public participation is the complexity of both parameterizing, operating, visualizing and interpreting results of complex ecohydrological models at various watershed scales that are sufficient to address diverse ecosystem service goals.

In fact, the importance of (model-based) prevention and early detection was highlighted in the recent European Union regulation on Invasive Alien Species. Models based on abundance estimates for different age/size classes would represent a significant improvement relative to the more usual models based only on species' occurrence data. Here, we evaluate the relative contribution of different environmental drivers to the spatial patterns of abundance of several height classes (or life-stages) of invasive tree populations at the regional scale, using a data-driven hierarchical modelling approach. A framework for modelling life-stages to obtain spatial projections of their potential occurrence or abundance has not been formalized before. We used Acacia dealbata (Silver-wattle) as a test species in northwest of Portugal, a heavily invaded region, and applied a multimodel inference to test the importance of various environmental drivers in explaining the abundance patterns of five plant height classes in local landscape mosaics. The ensemble of height classes is considered here as a proxy for population dynamics, life-stages and age of adult trees. In this test with A. dealbata, we used detailed field data on population height structure and calibrated an independent model for each height class. We found evidence to support our hypothesis that the distribution of height classes is mostly influenced by distinct factors operating at different scales. The spatial projections which resulted from several height class models provide an overview of population structure and invasion dynamics considering various life-stages, that is widely used in biodiversity and invasion research. The approach proposed here provides a framework to guide forest management to deal more effectively with plant invasions. It allows to test the effects of key invasion factors (depending on the focal species and on data availability) and supports the spatial identification of suitable areas for invasive species' occurrence while also accounting for the structural complexity of invasive species populations, thereby anticipating future invasion dynamics. The approach thus constitutes a step forward for establishing management actions at appropriate spatial scales and for focusing on earlier stages of invasion and their respective driving factors (regeneration niche), thereby enhancing the efficiency of control actions on major forest invaders.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:34:51","2023-12-07 17:40:13","","263–275","","","433","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5ZG2UR8M/Vicente et al. - 2019 - Different environmental drivers of alien tree invasion affect different life-stages and operate at different spa.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YL3RTU9Q/Vicente et al. - 2019 - Different environmental drivers of alien tree inva.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; T:Ecology; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Risk; Year 3; K:trees; K:management strategies; 2013T7-006; K:biological invasions; K:environmental factors; K:multimodel inference; K:scale-dependence; K:tree invasion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, anticipating how freshwater biodiversity will respond to surging flow regime alteration requires overcoming two challenges in environmental flow science: shifting from local to riverscape‐level understanding of biodiversity dynamics, and from static to time‐varying characterizations of the flow regime. Here, we used time‐series methods (wavelets and multivariate autoregressive models) to quantify flow‐regime alteration and to link time‐varying flow regimes to the dynamics of multiple local communities potentially connected by dispersal (i.e., a metacommunity). We studied the Chattahoochee River below Buford dam (Georgia, U.S.A.), and asked how flow regime alteration by a large hydropower dam may control the long‐term functional trajectory of the downstream invertebrate metacommunity. We found that seasonal variation in hydropeaking synchronized temporal fluctuations in trait abundance among the flow‐altered sites. Three biological trait states describing adaptation to fast flows benefitted from flow management for hydropower, but did not compensate for declines in 16 “loser” traits. Accordingly, metacommunity‐wide functional diversity responded negatively to hydropeaking intensity, and stochastic simulations showed that the risk of functional diversity collapse within the next 4 years would decrease by 17% if hydropeaking was ameliorated, or by 9% if it was applied every other season. Finally, an analysis of 97 reference and 23 dam‐affected river sites across the U.S. Southeast suggested that flow variation at extraneous, human‐relevant scales (12‐hr, 24‐hr, 1‐week) is relatively common in rivers affected by hydropower dams. This study advances the notion that novel flow regimes are widespread, and simplify the functional structure of riverine communities by filtering out taxa with nonadaptive traits and by spatially synchronizing their dynamics. This is relevant in the light of ongoing and future hydrologic alteration due to climate non‐stationarity and the new wave of dams planned globally.","2018-04","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:40:13","","3749-3765","","8","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/663S7CLJ/Ruhi et al. - 2018 - Detrimental effects of a novel flow regime on the .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/J56I83LM/gcb.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; 2016PF-025; T:Disturbance; K:hydrologic alteration; K:freshwater; K:biological traits; K:freshwater biodiversity; K:invertebrates; K:novel flow regimes; K:time-series methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One crop of concern to conservation is African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). We examined recent deforestation associated with oil palm in the Peruvian Amazon within the context of the region's other crops. We found more area under oil palm cultivation (845 km2) than did previous studies. While this comprises less than 4% of the cropland in the region, it accounted for 11% of the deforestation from agricultural expansion from 2007–2013. Patches of oil palm agriculture were larger and more spatially clustered than for other crops, potentially increasing their impact on local habitat fragmentation. Modeling deforestation risk for oil palm expansion using climatic and edaphic factors showed that sites at lower elevations, with higher precipitation, and lower slopes than those typically used for intensive agriculture are at long-term risk of deforestation from oil palm agriculture. Within areas at long-term risks, based on CART models, areas near urban centers, roads, and previously deforested areas are at greatest short-term risk of deforestation. Existing protected areas and officially recognized indigenous territories cover large areas at long-term risk of deforestation for oil palm (\textgreater40%). Less than 7% of these areas are under strict (IUCN I-IV) protection. Based on these findings, we suggest targeted monitoring for oil palm deforestation as well as strengthening and expanding protected areas to conserve specific habitats.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:30:27","2023-12-07 17:40:12","","","","11","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/AAL62XG5/Vijay et al. - 2018 - Deforestation risks posed by oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon.pdf","","2018; T:Landscapes at Risk; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2018PF-043; Year 8; K:deforestation; K:oil palm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Standard correlation and/or network analyses may be misleading when taken as an indication of taxon interactions because “correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causation”; environmental filtering can lead to correlation between non-interacting taxa. Unfortunately, microbial ecologists have generally used correlation as a proxy for causality although there is a general consensus about what constitutes a causal relationship: causes both precede and predict effects. We apply one of the first causal models for detecting interactions in human microbiome samples. Specifically, we analyze a long duration, high resolution time series of the human microbiome to decipher the networks of correlation and causation of human-associated microbial genera. We show that correlation is not a good proxy for biological interaction; we observed a weak negative relationship between correlation and causality. Strong interspecific interactions are disproportionately positive, whereas almost all strong intraspecific interactions are negative. Interestingly, intraspecific interactions also appear to act at a short timescale causing vast majority of the effects within 1–3 days. We report how different taxa are involved in causal relationships with others, and show that strong interspecific interactions are rarely conserved across two body sites whereas strong intraspecific interactions are much more conserved, ranging from 33% between the gut and right-hand to 70% between the two hands. Therefore, in the absence of guiding assumptions about ecological interactions, Granger causality and related techniques may be particularly helpful for understanding the driving factors governing microbiome composition and structure.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:30:15","2023-12-07 17:40:12","","e1007037","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","Staff; no acknowledgment; 2019; T:Ecology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:microbial ecology; K:community structure; K:charts; K:conservation science; K:human biome; K:interaction networks; K:microbiome; K:species interactions; K:tongue","","Morgan Langille","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, relatively little attention has been given to economic linkages between fisheries: If fishers consider multiple fisheries when deciding where, when, and how much to fish, there is potential for management decisions in one fishery to generate spillover impacts in other fisheries. We evaluate changes in participation and economic connectivity of fisheries following the implementation of Alaska's catch-share programs. Catch shares are increasingly used worldwide and typically implemented and evaluated on a single-fishery basis. We provide evidence that changes beyond the catch-share fishery have occurred, suggesting that spillovers should be considered when designing and evaluating catch-share policies.The emergence of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has broadened the policy scope of fisheries management by accounting for the biological and ecological connectivity of fisheries. Less attention, however, has been given to the economic connectivity of fisheries. If fishers consider multiple fisheries when deciding where, when, and how much to fish, then management changes in one fishery can generate spillover impacts in other fisheries. Catch-share programs are a popular fisheries management framework that may be particularly prone to generating spillovers given that they typically change fishers' incentives and their subsequent actions. We use data from Alaska fisheries to examine spillovers from each of the main catch-share programs in Alaska. We evaluate changes in participation—a traditional indicator in fisheries economics—in both the catch-share and non–catch-share fisheries. Using network analysis, we also investigate whether catch-share programs change the economic connectivity of fisheries, which can have implications for the socioeconomic resilience and robustness of the ecosystem, and empirically identify the set of fisheries impacted by each Alaska catch-share program. We find that cross-fishery participation spillovers and changes in economic connectivity coincide with some, but not all, catch-share programs. Our findings suggest that economic connectivity and the potential for cross-fishery spillovers deserve serious consideration, especially when designing and evaluating EBFM policies.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:30:16","2023-12-07 17:40:12","","201816545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/465AQEB2/4188.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 8; F:Actionable Research; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; F:Research Frameworks; 2018C19-019; K:networks; K:RFF; K:catch shares; K:ecosystem-based fisheries management; K:leakage; K:spillovers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This uniquely human form of adaptability is in large part to blame for the global sustainability crisis. This paper builds on cultural evolutionary theory to conceptualize and study environmental resource use and overexploitation. Human social learning and cooperation, particularly regarding social dilemmas, result in both sustainability crises and solutions. Examples include the collapse of global fisheries, and multilateral agreements to halt ozone depletion. We propose an explicitly evolutionary approach to study how crises and solutions may emerge, persist, or disappear. We first present a brief primer on cultural evolution to define group-level cultural adaptations for resource use. This includes criteria for identifying where group-level cultural adaptations may exist, and if a cultural evolutionary approach can be implemented in studying a given system. We then outline a step-by-step process for designing a study of group-level cultural adaptation, including the major methodological considerations that researchers should address in study design, such as tradeoffs between validity and control, issues of time scale, and the value of both qualitative and quantitative data and analysis. We discuss how to evaluate multiple types of evidence synthetically, including historical accounts, new and existing data sets, case studies, and simulations.

Instead, these hosts disappear into a void. This assumption lacks critical realism, because dead hosts can alter host–pathogen dynamics. Here, we develop a theoretical framework of carbon-based models combining disease and ecosystem perspectives to investigate the consequences of feedbacks between living and dead hosts on disease dynamics and carbon cycling. Because autotrophs (i.e. plants and phytoplankton) are critical regulators of carbon cycling, we developed general model structures and parameter combinations to broadly reflect disease of autotrophic hosts across ecosystems. Analytical model solutions highlight the importance of disease–ecosystem coupling. For example, decomposition rates of dead hosts mediate pathogen spread, and carbon flux between live and dead biomass pools are sensitive to pathogen effects on host growth and death rates. Variation in dynamics arising from biologically realistic parameter combinations largely fell along a single gradient from slow to fast carbon turnover rates, and models predicted higher disease impacts in fast turnover systems (e.g. lakes and oceans) than slow turnover systems (e.g. boreal forests). Our results demonstrate that a unified framework, including the effects of pathogens on carbon cycling, provides novel hypotheses and insights at the nexus of disease and ecosystem ecology.","2023-03","2023-05-23 14:23:15","2023-12-07 17:40:11","2023-05-23 14:23:15","e09880","","n/a","n/a","","","Dead or alive","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/oik.09880","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/U7T2SPDN/Seabloom et al. - Dead or alive carbon as a currency to integrate d.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DNC6DFNL/oik.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Year 7; T:Disease & Pests; 2023; F:Research Frameworks; 2017C17-033; K:disease ecology; K:ecosystem ecology; K:transmission; K:decomposition; K:pathogen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on ecological and conservation decision theory, we synthesise literature into a conceptual framework for species introduction decision-making based on ecological networks in high-uncertainty contexts. We demonstrate the application of this framework to a theoretical decision surrounding assisted migration considering both biodiversity and ecosystem service objectives.

Recently, several new socio-hydrologic models have been published that explore these dynamics, and these models offer unique opportunities to better understand these coupled systems and to understand how water problems evolve similarly in different regions. These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated streamflow, are insufficient, and new techniques must be developed. As socio-hydrology progresses, these models offer a robust, invaluable tool to test hypotheses about the relationships between aspects of coupled human-water systems.

The former, “adaptation effect”, relates to the observation that the occurrence of more frequent flooding is often associated with decreasing vulnerability. The latter, “levee effect”, relates to the observation that the non-occurrence of frequent flooding (possibly caused by flood protection structures, e.g. levees) is often associated to increasing vulnerability. As current analytical frameworks do not capture these dynamics, projections of future flood risk are not realistic. In this paper, we develop a new approach whereby the mutual interactions and continuous feedbacks between floods and societies are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, we show an application of this approach by using a socio-hydrological model to simulate the behavior of two main prototypes of societies: green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of flood-prone areas; and technological societies, which deal with flooding also by building levees or dikes. This application shows that the proposed approach is able to capture and explain the aforementioned dynamics (i.e. adaptation and levee effect) and therefore contribute to a better understanding of changes in flood risk, within an iterative process of theory development and empirical research.","2015-06","2020-11-17 20:35:27","2023-12-07 17:40:11","","4770–4781","","6","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","313 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5JNXY5UG/Baldassarre et al. - 2015 - Debates—Perspectives on socio-hydrology Capturing.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8TUG9G4U/2014WR016416.html","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; 2015; Year 2; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2013T5-001; F:Water & People; T:Risk; K:flooding; K:sociohydrology; K:flood risk; K:coupled dynamics; K:floodplain management; K:floodplains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such cross-scale causation presents a major challenge for developing a general understanding of how local decision-making shapes land-use changes at the global scale. This paper implements a generalized agent-based model (ABM) as a virtual laboratory to explore how global and local processes influence the land-use and livelihood decisions of local land-users, operationalized as settlement-level agents, across the landscapes of six real-world test sites. Test sites were chosen in USA, Laos, and China to capture globally-significant variation in population density, market influence, and environmental conditions, with land systems ranging from swidden to commercial agriculture. Publicly available global data were integrated into the ABM to model cross-scale effects of economic globalization on local land-use decisions. A suite of statistics was developed to assess the accuracy of model-predicted land-use outcomes relative to observed and random (i.e. null model) landscapes. At four of six sites, where environmental and demographic forces were important constraints on land-use choices, modeled land-use outcomes were more similar to those observed across sites than the null model. At the two sites in which market forces significantly influenced land-use and livelihood decisions, the model was a poorer predictor of land-use outcomes than the null model. Model successes and failures in simulating real-world land-use patterns enabled the testing of hypotheses on land-use decision-making and yielded insights on the importance of missing mechanisms. The virtual laboratory approach provides a practical framework for systematic improvement of both theory and predictive skill in land change science based on a continual process of experimentation and model enhancement.","2014-01","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:40:10","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science PMID: 24489696","","","","Staff; no acknowledgment; T:Agriculture; T:Natural Resource Management; K:agent-based modeling; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014; K:agriculture; K:land use; K:mathematical models; K:decision making; K:distance measurement; K:economic agents; K:population density","","Rodrigo Huerta-Quintanilla","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although farmers plant refuges of non-Bt host plants to delay pest resistance, this tactic has not been sufficient against the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera . In the United States, some populations of this devastating pest have rapidly evolved practical resistance to Cry3 toxins and Cry34/35Ab, the only Bt toxins in commercially available corn that kill rootworms. Here, we analyzed data from 2011 to 2016 on Bt corn fields producing Cry3Bb alone that were severely damaged by this pest in 25 crop-reporting districts of Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota. The annual mean frequency of these problem fields was 29 fields (range 7 to 70) per million acres of Cry3Bb corn in 2011 to 2013, with a cost of $163 to $227 per damaged acre. The frequency of problem fields declined by 92% in 2014 to 2016 relative to 2011 to 2013 and was negatively associated with rotation of corn with soybean. The effectiveness of corn rotation for mitigating Bt resistance problems did not differ significantly between crop-reporting districts with versus without prevalent rotation-resistant rootworm populations. In some analyses, the frequency of problem fields was positively associated with planting of Cry3 corn and negatively associated with planting of Bt corn producing both a Cry3 toxin and Cry34/35Ab. The results highlight the central role of crop rotation for mitigating impacts of D. v. virgifera resistance to Bt corn.","2020-07","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:40:10","","18385-18392","","35","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: National Academy of Sciences","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MS5EAQWV/Carrière et al. - 2020 - Crop rotation mitigates impacts of corn rootworm r.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/87DFMWDC/18385.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32690686","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Agriculture; Year 5; 2020; T:Disease & Pests; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2015C12-017; K:landscape analysis; K:resistance management; K:resistance mitigation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win-win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.","2018-08","2020-11-17 20:34:59","2023-12-07 17:40:10","","E7863–E7870","","33","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","361 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: National Academy of Sciences PMID: 30072434","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SLAJ5F4F/Karp et al. - 2018 - Crop pests and predators exhibit inconsistent responses to surrounding landscape composition.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Agriculture; K:biodiversity; Venture; Year 3; K:ecosystem functions; T:Disease & Pests; K:ecosystem services; K:agroecology; 2013V-021; K:natural enemies; K:biological control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to develop new knowledge that transcends each study, concerning two categories of variables: (1) the drivers of change in complex water-basin systems that affect systemic resilience; and (2) the features of adaptive governance. We have identified the pervasive themes, concepts, and variables of the systemic-change drivers and adaptive-governance features from these six interdisciplinary texts using qualitative methods of inductive textual analysis and synthesis. We produced synthesis frameworks for understanding the patterns that emerged from the basin assessment texts, as well as comprehensive lists of the variables that these studies uniformly or nearly uniformly addressed.

Research on the social-ecological drivers and impacts of winter weather whiplash is scarce because most studies only consider meteorological causes and consequences of extreme events. In this study, we used publicly available data of snowfall accumulation, vegetation phenology, road density, and per capita income to predict storm impacts, which we estimated with textual analysis of Halloween Nor’easter newspaper coverage. We demonstrated that a combination of meteorological, natural, and human system drivers was better able to predict the impact of the storm than meteorological drivers alone.

Given the uncertain costs of GI relative to other stormwater management strategies, stakeholders investing in GI need performance-analysis tools that consider the full suite of benefits and the impacts of uncertainty to help justify GI expenditures. This study provides a quantitative and comparative analysis of GI benefits, including nutrient uptake from stormwater and air pollutant deposition. Economic costs and benefits of GI are assessed using two metrics, benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) and nutrient removal costs, at three scales: household, subwatershed, and watershed scale. Results from a case study in the state of Maryland show that the costs of nutrient uptake at the subwatershed scale can be lower than those at either the watershed or household scales. Moreover, rain gardens are far more efficient in stormwater treatment at the household scale in comparison to watershed scale, for which large-scale dry or wet basins are more efficient. Using a BCR metric, smaller subwatersheds show more promise, while using a nutrient removal cost metric indicates that upstream subwatersheds are more suitable for stormwater treatment. The results also show that implementation of GI at all potential pervious locations does not necessarily increase nutrient removal costs and that self-installation of rain gardens greatly reduces nutrient removal costs. Finally, the results show that using numerous small-sized rain garden practices in front of residential buildings yields lower nutrient removal costs in comparison to permeable pavements placed in parking lots and commercial buildings.","2021-11","2021-11-12 17:06:31","2023-12-07 17:40:09","2021-11-12 17:06:30","114009","","","302","","Journal of Environmental Management","Cost/benefit assessment of green infrastructure","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FLMGTXYR/S0301479721020715.html","","F:Built Environment; T:Economics; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 2; T:Ecology; Venture; 2021; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; wrong DBI; K:watershed; K:green infrastructure; 2013V-018; K:Benefit cost assessment; K:Sensitivity; K:Spatial scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, using combined social and environmental perspectives to understand how people and wildlife are interlinked, together with the mechanisms that may weaken or strengthen those linkages, is of utmost importance. However, such integrated information is lacking. To help fill this information gap, we describe an integrated coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach for analyzing the patterns, causes, and consequences of changes in wildlife population and habitat, human population and land use, and their interactions. Using this approach, we synthesize research in two sites, Wolong Nature Reserve in China and Chitwan National Park in Nepal, to explicate key relationships between people and two globally endangered wildlife conservation icons, the giant panda and the Bengal tiger. This synthesis reveals that local resident characteristics such as household socioeconomics and demography, as well as community-level attributes such as resource management organizations, affect wildlife and their habitats in complex and even countervailing ways. Human impacts on wildlife and their habitats are in turn modifying the suite of ecosystem services that they provide to local residents in both sites, including access to forest products and cultural values. These interactions are further complicated by human and natural disturbance (e.g., civil wars, earthquakes), feedbacks (including policies), and telecouplings (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) that increasingly link the focal systems with other distant systems. We highlight several important implications of using a CHANS approach for wildlife research and conservation that is useful not only in China and Nepal but in many other places around the world facing similar challenges.","2014-09","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:40:09","","","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","81 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:endangered species; Year 3; 2014; 2013PF-009; T:Wildlife; K:complex systems; K:interdisciplinary science; K:conservation; K:wildlife science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While insecticide use supports food, fuel, and fiber production, it can also threaten non-target organisms, a concern underscored by mounting evidence of widespread decline of pollinator populations. Here, we integrate several public datasets to generate county-level annual estimates of total ‘bee toxic load’ (honey bee lethal doses) for insecticides applied in the US between 1997–2012, calculated separately for oral and contact toxicity. To explore the underlying components of the observed changes, we divide bee toxic load into extent (area treated) and intensity (application rate x potency). We show that while contact-based bee toxic load remained relatively steady, oral-based bee toxic load increased roughly 9-fold, with reductions in application rate outweighed by disproportionate increases in potency (toxicity/kg) and extent. This pattern varied markedly by region, with the greatest increase seen in Heartland (121-fold increase), likely driven by use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in corn and soybean. In this “potency paradox”, farmland in the central US has become more hazardous to bees despite lower volumes of insecticides applied, raising concerns about insect conservation and highlighting the importance of integrative approaches to pesticide use monitoring.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:30:05","2023-12-07 17:40:09","","797","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","68 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HPVKSJCC/s41598-019-57225-w.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2020; Year 7; T:Ecology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Vulnerability & Risk; 2017C16-006; K:bees; K:insecticides; K:insects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because each company defines its own zero-deforestation commitment goals and implementation mechanisms, commitment content varies widely. This creates challenges for the assessment of commitment implementation or effectiveness. Here, we develop criteria to assess the potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments at reducing deforestation within a company supply chain, regionally, and globally. We apply these criteria to evaluate 52 zero-deforestation commitments made by companies identified by Forest 500 as having high deforestation risk. While our assessment indicates that existing commitments converge with several criteria for effectiveness, they fall short in a few key ways. First, they cover just a small share of the global market for deforestation-risk commodities, which means that their global impact is likely to be small. Second, biome-wide implementation is only achieved in the Brazilian Amazon. Outside this region, implementation occurs mainly through certification programs, which are not adopted by all producers and lack third-party near-real time deforestation monitoring. Additionally, around half of all commitments include zero-net deforestation targets and future implementation deadlines, both of which are design elements that may reduce effectiveness. Zero-net targets allow promises of future reforestation to compensate for current forest loss, while future implementation deadlines allow for preemptive clearing. To increase the likelihood that commitments will lead to reduced deforestation across all scales, more companies should adopt zero-gross deforestation targets with immediate implementation deadlines and clear sanction-based implementation mechanisms in biomes with high risk of forest to commodity conversion.","2018-12","2020-11-17 20:34:47","2023-12-07 17:40:09","","135–147","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","96 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/85965KLW/Garrett et al. - 2018 - Criteria for effective zero-deforestation commitments.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IJDK7DRY/Garrett et al. - 2019 - Criteria for effective zero-deforestation commitme.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; 2016C13-002; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Conservation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; F:Research Frameworks; K:agriculture; K:forestry; K:conservation; K:supply chain; K:sustainability standards; K:voluntary environmental policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes may be linked to observed population declines in wildlife, including barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a key species of Arctic environments. We quantified how barren-ground caribou, characteristically both gregarious and migratory, synchronize births in time and aggregate births in space and investigated how these tactics are influenced by variable weather conditions. We analyzed movement patterns to infer calving dates for 747 collared female caribou from seven herds across northern North America, totaling 1255 calving events over a 15-year period. By relating these events to local weather conditions during the 1-year period preceding calving, we examined how weather influenced calving timing and the ability of caribou to reach their central calving area. We documented continental-scale synchrony in calving, but synchrony was greatest within an individual herd for a given year. Weather conditions before and during gestation had contrasting effects on the timing and location of calving. Notably, a combination of unfavorable weather conditions during winter and spring, including the pre-calving migration, resulted in a late arrival on the calving area or a failure to reach the greater calving area in time for calving. Though local weather conditions influenced calving timing differently among herds, warm temperatures and low wind speed, which are associated with soft, deep snow, during the spring and pre-calving migration, generally affected the ability of female caribou to reach central calving areas in time to give birth. Delayed calving may have potential indirect consequences, including reduced calf survival. Overall, we detected considerable variability across years and across herds, but no significant trend for earlier calving by caribou, even as broad indicators of spring and snow phenology trend earlier. Our results emphasize the importance of monitoring the timing and location of calving, and to examine how weather during summer and winter are affecting calving and subsequent reproductive success.","2023-01","2023-01-31 15:05:45","2023-12-07 17:40:08","2023-01-31 15:05:45","e4399","","1","14","","","Continental synchrony and local responses","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4399","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/K5Q2FW6A/Couriot et al. - 2023 - Continental synchrony and local responses Climati.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6C3J9ZZK/ecs2.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 9; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2023; K:migration; 2019PF-049; T:Wildlife; K:caribou; K:weather; K:birth location; K:birth timing; K:environmental gradients; K:parturition; K:Rangifer tarandus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These global stressors: cannot be avoided by local management, compound local stressors, and hasten the loss of ecosystem services. Impacts to people will be most grave where a) human dependence on coral reef ecosystems is high, b) sea surface temperature reaches critical levels soonest, and c) ocean acidification levels are most severe. Where these elements align, swift action will be needed to protect people’s lives and livelihoods, but such action must be informed by data and science. An Indicator Approach Designing policies to offset potential harm to coral reef ecosystems and people requires a better understanding of where CO2-related global environmental stresses could cause the most severe impacts. Mapping indicators has been proposed as a way of combining natural and social science data to identify policy actions even when the needed science is relatively nascent. To identify where people are at risk and where more science is needed, we map indicators of biological, physical and social science factors to understand how human dependence on coral reef ecosystems will be affected by globally-driven threats to corals expected in a high-CO2 world. Western Mexico, Micronesia, Indonesia and parts of Australia have high human dependence and will likely face severe combined threats. As a region, Southeast Asia is particularly at risk. Many of the countries most dependent upon coral reef ecosystems are places for which we have the least robust data on ocean acidification. These areas require new data and interdisciplinary scientific research to help coral reef-dependent human communities better prepare for a high CO2 world.","2016-11-09","2020-11-17 20:35:25","2023-12-07 17:40:08","2021-11-22 21:54:28","","","11","11","","PLOS ONE","Coral Reefs and People in a High-CO2 World","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","61 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QBJLJHMD/Pendleton et al. - 2016 - Coral Reefs and People in a High-CO2 World Where .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/G5462WZV/article.html","","T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Year 1; T:Climate Change; 2016; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Policy & Regulation; 2012V-004; K:bleaching; K:carbon dioxide; K:coral reefs; K:ecological risk; K:marine ecology; K:ocean temperature; K:reef ecosystems; K:surface temperature; K:Venture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The food waste problem is well characterized, but solutions are not: there has been little rigorous comparison of the costs and potential benefits of food waste reduction interventions. Food waste reduction is often described as a “win–win,” benefiting consumers, the environment, and businesses’ bottom line. We present a method for evaluating this claim by accounting for the costs and environmental benefits of food waste reduction. The procedure involves assembling data on costs and efficacy of the intervention, scaling the costs up to the national level, estimating the quantity and value of food waste averted, and finally estimating the potential averted environmental impact. We apply our method to four representative nationwide interventions: consumer education and public awareness campaigns, spoilage prevention packaging for produce and meat, standardization of date labels, and foodservice waste tracking systems. The estimated annual cost of each intervention varied from $126 to $595 million. The environmental cost-effectiveness of the interventions varied two- to three-fold (for example, 6 to 16 kg CO2 reduced per $1 invested). Outstanding questions include how to scale interventions to the national level and how to address the mismatch between who incurs the costs of implementation and who benefits. Our method can be adapted to waste interventions across the food system and in countries beyond the United States.","2021-05","2021-06-01 00:04:02","2023-12-07 17:40:08","2021-06-01 00:04:02","105448","","","168","","Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Cost-effectiveness of four food waste interventions","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PNBI6UTU/Read and Muth - 2021 - Cost-effectiveness of four food waste intervention.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FF5VNHSN/S0921344921000550.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; Foundation; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 6; 2021; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2017F-010; 2018PF-041; Year 8 (QR); K:food waste; K:consumer education; K:cost-effectiveness; K:date labeling; K:packaging; K:waste tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of biological invasions, they can contribute to anticipating risks and adaptively managing invaders. However, monitoring is often expensive because large amounts of data might be needed to draw inferences. Thus, careful planning is required to ensure that monitoring goals are realistically achieved. Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates of suitable areas to invasion. Predictions from these models can be applied as inputs in optimization strategies seeking to identify the optimal extent of the networks of areas required for monitoring risk of invasion under current and future environmental conditions. A hierarchical framework is proposed herein that combines SDMs, scenario analysis and cost analyses to improve invasion assessments at regional and local scales. We illustrate the framework with Acacia dealbata Link. (Silver-wattle) in northern Portugal. The framework is general and applicable to any species. We defined two types of monitoring networks focusing either on the regional-scale management of an invasion, or management focus within and around protected areas. For each one of these two schemes, we designed a hierarchical framework of spatial prioritization using different information layers (e.g. SDMs, habitat connectivity, protected areas). We compared the performance of each monitoring scheme against 100 randomly generated models. In our case study, we found that protected areas will be increasingly exposed to invasion by A. dealbata due to climate change. Moreover, connectivity between suitable areas for A. dealbata is predicted to increase. Monitoring networks that we identify were more effective in detecting new invasions and less costly to management than randomly generated models. The most cost-efficient monitoring schemes require 18% less effort than the average networks across all of the 100 tested options. Synthesis and applications. The proposed framework achieves cost-effective monitoring networks, enabling the interactive exploration of different solutions and the combination of quantitative information on network performance with orientations that are rarely incorporated in a decision support system. The framework brings invasion monitoring closer to European legislation and management needs while ensuring adaptability under rapid climate and environmental change.","2016-10","2020-11-17 20:35:26","2023-12-07 17:40:08","","1317–1329","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; K:species distribution models; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; 2016; Year 3; F:Research Frameworks; K:species distribution; 2013T7-006; K:ecological monitoring; K:ecological monitoring programs","","Marc Cadotte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found relatively consistent and strong relationships with both average professionalization (staff and budget index) and diversity of groups’ focus and the number of groups’ activity areas in a block group or neighborhood, suggesting a potential density dependence effect. Overall, the number of stewardship groups correlates with social and environmental aspects at both scales across all cities, but variation across cities for specific variables indicates the need for further analyses to unpack why we observe these different patterns across cities. Strong relationships with organizational factors suggest future directions for stewardship research and that the organizational landscape may affect how many groups work in a place more than socioeconomic or environmental conditions.","2019-10","2020-11-17 20:34:32","2023-12-07 17:40:08","","","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2017PF-031; T:Political Science; K:urban ecology; K:environmental justice; K:collaboration; K:civic stewardship; K:social-environmental; K:spatial analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the simultaneous effects of intensification on biodiversity and yield. To determine the responses of species richness and yield to conventional intensification, we conducted a global meta-analysis synthesizing 115 studies which collected data for both variables at the same locations. We extracted 449 cases that cover a variety of areas used for agricultural (crops, fodder) and silvicultural (wood) production. We found that, across all production systems and species groups, conventional intensification is successful in increasing yield (grand mean + 20.3%), but it also results in a loss of species richness (−8.9%). However, analysis of sub-groups revealed inconsistent results. For example, small intensification steps within low intensity systems did not affect yield or species richness. Within high-intensity systems species losses were non-significant but yield gains were substantial (+15.2%). Conventional intensification within medium intensity systems revealed the highest yield increase (+84.9%) and showed the largest loss in species richness (−22.9%). Production systems differed in their magnitude of richness response, with insignificant changes in silvicultural systems and substantial losses in crop systems (−21.2%). In addition, this meta-analysis identifies a lack of studies that collect robust biodiversity (i.e. beyond species richness) and yield data at the same sites and that provide quantitative information on land-use intensity. Our findings suggest that, in many cases, conventional land-use intensification drives a trade-off between species richness and production. However, species richness losses were often not significantly different from zero, suggesting even conventional intensification can result in yield increases without coming at the expense of biodiversity loss. These results should guide future research to close existing research gaps and to understand the circumstances required to achieve such win-win or win-no-harm situations in conventional agriculture.","2019-04","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:40:08","","gcb.14606","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","139 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 3; T:Environmental History; K:meta-analysis; K:land use change; 2013T7-011; K:land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amount of government funding available for species protection and recovery is one of the best predictors of successful recovery; however, government spending is both insufficient and highly disproportionate among groups of species, and there is significant discrepancy between proposed and actualized budgets across species. In light of an increasing list of imperiled species requiring evaluation and protection, an explicit approach to allocating recovery funds is urgently needed. Here, I provide a formal decision-theoretic approach focusing on return on investment as an objective and a transparent mechanism to achieve the desired recovery goals. I found that less than 25% of the $1.21 billion/year needed for implementing recovery plans for 1,125 species is actually allocated to recovery. Spending in excess of the recommended recovery budget does not necessarily translate into better conservation outcomes. Rather, elimination of only the budget surplus for “costly yet futile” recovery plans can provide sufficient funding to erase funding deficits for more than 180 species. Triage by budget compression provides better funding for a larger sample of species, and a larger sample of adequately funded recovery plans should produce better outcomes even if by chance. Sharpening our focus on deliberate decision making offers the potential to achieve desired outcomes in avoiding extinction for Endangered Species Act-listed species.","2016-03","2022-08-08 18:09:11","2023-12-07 17:40:07","2022-08-08 18:09:11","3563-3566","","13","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","90 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8JYQC8DU/Gerber - 2016 - Conservation triage or injurious neglect in endang.pdf","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; Venture; 2016; T:Policy & Regulation; K:endangered species; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:ESA; K:Endangered Species Act (ESA); K:decision-making; 2015V-035; K:Endangered Species Act; K:Decision making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Negative outcomes from seafood mislabeling are suspected to be substantial and pervasive as seafood is the world’s most highly traded food commodity. Here we provide empirical systems-level evidence that enabling conditions exist for seafood mislabeling in the United States (US) to lead to negative impacts on marine populations and support consumption of products from poorly managed fisheries. Using trade, production, and mislabeling data, we determine that substituted products are more likely to be imported than the product listed on the label. We also estimate that about 60% of US mislabeled apparent consumption associated with the established pairs involves products that are exclusively wild caught. We use these wild-caught pairs to explore population and management consequences of mislabeling. We find that, compared to the product on the label, substituted products come from fisheries with less healthy stocks and greater impacts of fishing on other species. Additionally, substituted products are from fisheries with less effective management and with management policies less likely to mitigate impacts of fishing on habitats and ecosystems compared with the label product. While we provide systematic evidence of environmental impacts from food fraud, our results also highlight the current challenges with production, trade, and mislabeling data, which increase the uncertainty surrounding seafood mislabeling consequences. More integrated, holistic, and collaborative approaches are needed to understand mislabeling impacts and design interventions to minimize mislabeling.","2020-11","2020-11-23 19:14:25","2023-12-07 17:40:07","2020-11-23 19:14:14","30318-30323","","48","117","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

Here, we first present a systematic literature survey on the frequency and treatment of missing data in published ecological meta-analyses showing that the majority of meta-analyses encountered incompletely reported studies. We then simulated meta-analysis data sets to investigate the performance of 14 options to treat or impute missing SDs and/or SSs. Performance was thereby assessed using results from fully informed weighted analyses on (hypothetically) complete data sets. We show that the omission of incompletely reported studies is not a viable solution. Unweighted and sample size-based variance approximation can yield unbiased grand means if effect sizes are independent of their corresponding SDs and SSs. The performance of different imputation methods depends on the structure of the meta-analysis data set, especially in the case of correlated effect sizes and standard deviations or sample sizes. In a best-case scenario, which assumes that SDs and/or SSs are both missing at random and are unrelated to effect sizes, our simulations show that the imputation of up to 90% of missing data still yields grand means and confidence intervals that are similar to those obtained with fully informed weighted analyses. We conclude that multiple imputation of missing variance measures and sample sizes could help overcome the problem of incompletely reported primary studies, not only in the field of ecological meta-analyses. Still, caution must be exercised in consideration of potential correlations and pattern of missingness.","2020-10","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2023-12-07 17:40:07","","11699-11712","","20","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; 2020; T:Modeling; Year 3; K:meta-analysis; 2013T7-011; K:meta-analyses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Propagule pressure is a major contributor to the probability of invading species establishment; however, direct assessment of numbers of individuals arriving is virtually never possible. Inspections conducted at borders by biosecurity officials record counts of species (or higher-level taxa) intercepted during inspections, which can be used as proxies for arrival rates. Such data may therefore be useful for predicting species establishments, though some species may establish despite never being intercepted. We present a stochastic process-based model of the arrival–interception–establishment process to predict species establishment risk from interception count data. The model can be used to estimate the probability of establishment, both for species that were intercepted and species that had no interceptions during a given observation period. We fit the stochastic model to data on two insect families, Cerambycidae and Aphididae, that were intercepted and/or established in the United States or New Zealand. We also explore the effects of variation in model parameters and the inclusion of an Allee effect in the establishment probability. Although interception data sets contain much noise due to variation in inspection policy, interception effort and among-species differences in detectability, our study shows that it is possible to use such data for predicting establishments and distinguishing differences in establishment risk profile between taxonomic groups. Our model provides a method for predicting the number of species that have breached border biosecurity, including both species detected during inspections but also “unseen arrivals” that have never been intercepted, but have not yet established a viable population. These estimates could inform prioritization of different taxonomic groups, pathways or identification effort in biosecurity programs.","2020-06","2020-11-17 20:30:00","2023-12-07 17:40:07","","eap.2194","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/UGV3FX8T/Turner et al. - 2020 - Considering unseen arrivals in predictions of esta.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; 2020; Year 7; T:Ecology; F:Actionable Research; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; K:biosecurity; 2017C17-011; K:insects; K:aphididae; K:cerambycidae; K:interception; K:species establishment; K:stochastic process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, models that predict dynamics such as risk of extinction, range shifts, and biodiversity loss tend to rely on the mean value of parameters and rarely incorporate realistic dispersal mechanisms. By focusing on the mean population value, variation among individuals or variability caused by complex spatial and temporal dynamics is ignored. This calls for increased efforts to understand individual variation in dispersal and integrate it more explicitly into population and community models involving dispersal. However, the sources, magnitude and outcomes of intraspecific variation in dispersal are poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of the role of dispersal in mediating the dynamics of communities and their response to global change. In this manuscript, we synthesize recent research that examines the sources of individual variation in dispersal and emphasize its implications for plant fitness, populations and communities. We argue that this intraspecific variation in seed dispersal does not simply add noise to systems, but, in fact, alters dispersal processes and patterns with consequences for demography, communities, evolution, and response to anthropogenic changes. We conclude with recommendations for moving this field of research forward.","2019-07","2020-11-17 20:34:38","2023-12-07 17:40:07","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","66 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Narnia","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JYXDJGNZ/Snell et al. - 2019 - Consequences of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal for plant demography, communities, evolution and global.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; 2019; F:Biodiversity; T:Modeling; T:Risk; 2015PF-016; K:global change; K:variability; 2018PF-037; K:seed dispersal; Year 5 (NB); Year 8 (EF); T:Wildlife; K:interspecific; K:intraspecific; K:long-distance dispersal; K:population; K:spread; K:within species; K:workshop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these impacts is the potential for increased levels of conflict and accordingly, researchers are examining the relationship between climate variability and conflict. Thus far, there is a lack of consensus on the direction of this relationship. We contribute to the climate variability and conflict literature by incorporating Markov transitional probabilities into panel logit models to analyze how monthly deviations in rainfall affect the likelihood that a grid cell transitions to an above average level of conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa. To control for differences in seasons across the continent, we model this relationship for each of the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa separately – East, Central, West, and Southern. We find significant seasonal and regional effects between rainfall and the probability that a grid cell transitions from a state of peace to a state of conflict. In particular, above average rainfall is associated with a higher likelihood of transitioning into conflict during the dry season. Further, each region has specific months—primarily those associated with prime crop harvest periods—where variations in rainfall significantly influence conflict. We also find regional variations in the linkage between rainfall and conflict type related to the types of conflict that predominate in particular regions of Sub- Saharan Africa. These findings are important for policymakers because they suggest additional law enforcement and/or peacekeeping resources may be needed in times of above average rainfall. Policies that provide financial support for farmers or other sectors, such as mining, that are impacted by rainfall patterns may also be a useful strategy for conflict mitigation.","2021-06","2021-05-28 19:43:41","2023-12-07 17:40:06","2021-05-28 19:43:41","","","","775","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LDJ8FR4Q/Mack et al. - 2021 - Conflict and its relationship to climate variabili.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PNHCRLIA/Mack et al. - 2021 - Conflict and its relationship to climate variabili.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5Q8LR86H/S0048969721007142.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6R2QNBUQ/S0048969721007142.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Climate Change; reported to NSF; Year 8; 2021; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:climate change; 2018C19-001; K:conflict; K:markov chains; K:pursuit; K:rainfall; K:sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They require action at the scale of large landscapes given that the geographic scope of the issues often transcends the legal and geographic reach of existing jurisdictions and institutions. No single entity has the authority to address these types of cross-boundary issues, resulting in gaps in governance and a corresponding need to create formal and informal ways work more effectively across administrative boundaries, land ownerships, and political jurisdictions. In response to this challenge, numerous models of “network governance” are emerging. These approaches vary in terms of purpose, spatial scale, composition, organization, and complexity.

Reversing the decline of the North Pacific loggerhead turtle is a priority articulated in US, Japanese, and Mexican natural resources policy. However, by 2005, while nesting beach protection was strong in Japan and bycatch reduction had been achieved in U.S. Hawaii-based longline fisheries, bycatch mortality was very high in Mexican artisanal fisheries and believed to be problematic in Japanese coastal fisheries. Efforts to conserve the population were hindered by lack of understanding and cooperation by and between fishers, conservation practitioners, scientists, and managers of all three countries. The authors produced a trinational FLE with participants from Japan, Mexico, and Hawaii to share bycatch challenges and develop solutions. The trinational FLE gave fishers and other participants new, otherwise unattainable knowledge, perspectives, and experiences that empowered them as leaders among their peers, resulting in unexpectedly strong cultural and conservation outcomes that included: a) understanding of the myriad threats to loggerheads throughout their ranges and lifetimes, b) development of a transpacific conservation partnerships to undertake coordinated recovery efforts, c) participatory research to develop and test bycatch reduction technological and practical solutions for Japan and Mexico, and d) hundreds of juvenile loggerheads spared per yr from bycatch mortality via changes in fishing practices by FLE participants. The authors conclude that the reciprocal FLE can serve as a practical tool with potential for broad application for empowering fishers and other fisheries stakeholders to improve fisheries.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:40:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BDLHTX6G/Peckham et al. - 2017 - Connecting fishers to conserve a transpacific amba.pdf","","2017; no acknowledgment; Year 1; Workshop; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2012W-005; K:fisheries learning exchange; K:fisheries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the course of the Zika outbreak in the Americas, several ecological models were developed to forecast the potential global distribution of the disease. Conflicting results produced by alternative methods are unresolved, hindering the development of appropriate public health forecasts. We compare ecological niche models and experimentally-driven mechanistic forecasts for Zika transmission in the continental United States. We use generic and uninformed stochastic county-level simulations to demonstrate the downstream epidemiological consequences of conflict among ecological models, and show how assumptions and parameterization in the ecological and epidemiological models propagate uncertainty and produce downstream model conflict. We conclude by proposing a basic consensus method that could resolve conflicting models of potential outbreak geography and seasonality. Our results illustrate the usually-undocumented margin of uncertainty that could emerge from using any one of these predictions without reservation or qualification. In the short term, ecologists face the task of developing better post hoc consensus that accurately forecasts spatial patterns of Zika virus outbreaks. Ultimately, methods are needed that bridge the gap between ecological and epidemiological approaches to predicting transmission and realistically capture both outbreak size and geography.","2018-12","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:40:06","","4921","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","47 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YJSDSB6P/Carlson et al. - 2018 - Consensus and conflict among ecological forecasts .pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 8; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:modeling; K:pandemic; 2018PF-057; K:pandemic prediction; K:zika virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated body condition and survival during breeding and non-breeding periods in two closely related species with notably different reproductive systems. Male and female saltmarsh sparrows Ammodramus caudacutus represent extremes in parental care: males perform none, leaving females to do everything from build nests to care for fledglings. In contrast, male and female seaside sparrows A. maritimus have bi-parental care and similar levels of reproductive investment, intermediate between male and female saltmarsh sparrows. Our results are consistent with the idea that females experience non-lethal effects of reproduction, and that differences between the breeding season and winter affect condition. In both species, females had lower scaled mass index (SMI) values than males during both breeding and non-breeding seasons, and female saltmarsh sparrows had lower SMI values than female seaside sparrows. Females carried more fat than males during the breeding season, and female, but not male, fat and muscle scores decreased over time, which is consistent with the adaptive mass hypothesis. In winter, all groups carried more fat and had higher muscle scores than when breeding, despite having lower SMI scores. Although we observed variation in body condition, within-season survival was uniformly high in both seasons, suggesting that sex, species, season, body size, and body condition have little impacts on within season survival. Comparisons with previously-published estimates of annual adult survival suggest that most mortality occurs during migration, even in these short-distance migrants. The importance of considering multiple aspects of body condition, multiple seasons, and difficult-to-monitor events, such as migration, should not be ignored when thinking about the events and processes that cumulatively determine population dynamics.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:40:06","","","","4","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IRK8SIMT/Borowske et al. - 2018 - Consequences of breeding system for body condition.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7P6E5NKC/jav.html","","2018; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2017PF-036; T:Wildlife; K:birds; K:parental investment; K:body condition; K:survival; K:tidal marsh sparrows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, Schlesinger (2010) called for development of a “translational ecology” that would be understandable and usable by decision-makers, interest groups, and citizens. A barrier to usable science is that researchers are not usually trained to be translational. We convened a multi-disciplinary group of scholars to identify a comprehensive pedagogical approach for training doctoral students to be translational scientists. From this work has emerged a list of 53 skills, content areas, and dispositional attributes that lead to translational research in environmental science, as well as a set of instructional approaches that can be used to build those competencies.

We provide lessons learned, based on over 200 years of the authors' cumulative and diverse experience, about PM processes. These include successful and, perhaps more importantly, not-so-successful trials. Our collective interdisciplinary background has supported the development, testing, and evaluation of a rich range of collaborative modeling approaches. We share here what we have learned as a community of participatory modelers, within three categories of reflection: a) lessons learned about participatory modelers; b) lessons learned about the context of collaboration; and c) lessons learned about the PM process. First, successful PM teams encompass a variety of skills beyond modeling expertise. Skills include: effective relationship-building, openness to learn from local experts, awareness of personal motivations and biases, and ability to translate discussions into models and to assess success. Second, the context for collaboration necessitates a culturally appropriate process for knowledge generation and use, for involvement of community co-leads, and for understanding group power dynamics that might influence how people from different backgrounds interact. Finally, knowing when to use PM and when not to, managing expectations, and effectively and equitably addressing conflicts is essential. Managing the participation process in PM is as important as managing the model building process. We recommend that PM teams consider what skills are present within a team, while ensuring inclusive creative space for collaborative exploration and learning supported by simple yet relevant models. With a realistic view of what it entails, PM can be a powerful approach that builds collective knowledge and social capital, thus helping communities to take charge of their future and address complex social and environmental problems.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2023-12-07 17:41:56","","0","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; Pursuit; 2019; T:Natural Resource Management; 2015T11-012; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; K:collaborative modeling; T:Team Science & Collaborations; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; F:Science of Team Science; K:interdisciplinary; K:stakeholder engagement; K:environmental management; K:Participatory modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing from the growing body of research on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), the paper identifies two dominant vantage points—one focused on promoting more efficient production methods and products (mainly through technological improvement and informed consumer choice) and the other stressing the need to consider also overall volumes of consumption, distributional issues, and related social and institutional changes. We label these two approaches efficiency and systemic. Research shows that while the efficiency approach contains essential elements of a transition to sustainability, it is by itself highly unlikely to bring about sustainable outcomes. Concomitantly, research also finds that volumes of consumption and production are closely associated with environmental impacts, indicating a need to curtail these volumes in ways that safeguard social sustainability, which is unlikely to be possible without a restructuring of existing socioeconomic arrangements. Analysing how these two perspectives are reflected in the SDGs framework, we find that in its current conception, it mainly relies on the efficiency approach. On the basis of this assessment, we conclude that the SDGs represent a partial and inadequate conceptualisation of SCP which will hamper implementation. Based on this determination, this paper provides some suggestions on how governments and other actors involved in SDGs operationalisation could more effectively pursue SCP from a systemic standpoint and use the transformation of systems of consumption and production as a lever for achieving multiple sustainability objectives.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2023-12-07 17:41:56","","1533–1547","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","207 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Japan","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SSHCGNA6/Bengtsson et al. - 2018 - Transforming systems of consumption and production.pdf","","2018; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; T:Agriculture; Workshop; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Sustainable Development Goals; K:consumption; 2016W-063; K:public policy; K:SDG; K:systemic approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, different studies have chosen different radii without clear reasons, hampering the understanding of mechanisms structuring tree communities. Using functional trait and tree demography data from the Luquillo subtropical forest in Puerto Rico, we compared fixed-neighbourhood models with a canopy overlap model, in which tree crown overlap is used as an indicator of neighbourhood crowding. Analyses that combine functional trait and demographic data provide a mechanistic understanding of observed patterns of community structure and dynamics as they provide insights into the linkages between phenotypes and the environment. Overall, canopy overlap models had better support when compared to neighbourhood models using a fixed radius, suggesting that the fixed radius approach does not capture the full extent of competitive interactions among trees. Moreover, the effects of functional neighbourhood on tree survival and growth differ depending on the type of approach used and lead to different conclusions with respect to the drivers of tree community dynamics. Synthesis. In summary, our findings highlight the utility of neighbourhood models based on tree crown overlap, and suggest that applying this same approach to different plots and forests will facilitate comparisons across systems and improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the structure and dynamics of tree communities.","2018-09","2020-11-17 20:34:55","2023-12-07 17:41:56","","887-900","","2","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/89CHYAT7/Zambrano et al. - 2018 - Tree crown overlap improves predictions of the functional neighbourhood effects on tree survival and growth.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZS7AUFE3/Zambrano et al. - 2019 - Tree crown overlap improves predictions of the fun.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZLI79NNW/1365-2745.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2015PF-017; K:neighborhood model; K:functional traits; K:Luquillo Forest; K:neighbourhood models; K:niche differentiation; K:traits","","Peter Bellingham","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholarship on Section 7 characterizes the process as unwaveringly rigid, the legal “hammer” forcing federal agencies to consider endangered species' needs when proposing operations and management plans for federally funded irrigation. In this paper, we identify barriers to an integrated approach to Section 7 implementation and characterize a set of strategies for overcoming its rigidity that may have broader applicability. We draw on lessons derived from the Klamath Basin along the Oregon-California border, where cross-scale processes and venues involving interagency collaboration among leaders in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation supported efforts to replace an ecologically and socially fragmented Upper Basin/Lower Basin approach to ESA implementation fraught with conflict. The result was the nation's first joint biological opinion (BiOp), which effectively institutionalized an adaptive, flexible, integrated approach to water sharing among competing interests. Keys to success included existing collaborative capacity related to shifting stakeholder networks, trust, and relationships and a shift in local agency culture facilitated by empathic leadership leading to a greater sense of shared responsibility for Section 7 compliance. A collaborative hydrologic modeling process enhanced participatory capacity, facilitated transformative social and technical learning, and cultivated greater understanding of the social-ecological system among key stakeholders. The 2013 joint BiOp exemplifies both governmental capacity for flexibility and evolution within the constraints of formal law and the potential for greater integration among federal agencies and between federal agencies and stakeholders involved in ESA implementation.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:41:56","","","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","","","2017; Pursuit; Year 2; F:Biodiversity; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2013T5-006; K:adaptive management; K:adaptive capacity; K:hydrologic modeling; K:Endangered Species Act; K:biological opinion; K:Klamath Basin; K:trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paying attention to how practices ‘on the ground’ can—and should—inform policy and planning requires disrupting the silos in which these entities frequently operate. Yet in practice, bridging disparate fields of inquiry towards a common goal is a difficult task, and few empirical examples exist to guide researchers interested in using TR to examine environmental health issues in real-world contexts. In this paper, we reflect on the design and execution of a collaborative, transdisciplinary project that examines localized effects of urban and environmental governance on urban subsistence fishing as a foodway with key health implications. We first review the socio-environmental literatures on urban fishing to outline the utility of TR. Next, we present our TR synthesis, which integrates secondary data from federal, state, and municipal agencies in two U.S. Gulf Coast metropolitan areas, including a subset of results to demonstrate TR in action. Finally, we critically reflect on our TR experience in relation to corresponding theory, allowing insight into the strengths and drawbacks of utilizing TR in practice. Benefits include a more holistic linkage of complex socio-environmental components, the illumination of power dynamics between stakeholders, and the co-creation of knowledge in a multidisciplinary research team. The challenges we faced highlight issues of translation across disciplinary methods when framing research questions and when integrating data sources collected for different sectoral purposes. In particular, we discuss the role of synthesis—the triangulation of diverse secondary sources—to the practice of TR. We share these lessons to inform further integrated research on the relationships between place-based health, urban development, and environmental equity.","2020-10","2021-05-28 19:39:49","2023-12-07 17:41:55","2021-05-28 19:39:49","","","","","","","Transdisciplinary synthesis research in unruly environments","","","","","","","en","","","","","projections.pubpub.org","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: PubPub","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NQJSSAPU/Drakopulos et al. - 2020 - Transdisciplinary Synthesis Research in Unruly Env.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DAYR76NG/Drakopulos et al. - 2020 - Transdisciplinary Synthesis Research in Unruly Env.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MX2GNWQ9/1.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/375MXXMI/1.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; reported to NSF; C:Case Study; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2020; Year 7; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2017GS4-006; K:synthesis; K:transdisciplinary research; K:co-creation; K:interdisciplinary research; K:power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, actual changes in doctoral-level marine science programs lag behind this literature considerably. This is in part because of concerns about the time investment in cross-disciplinary education and about the job prospects offered by such programs. There is also a more fundamental divide between educational programs that focus on knowledge generation and those that focus on professional development, which can reinforce the gap in communication between scientists and marine resource managers. Ultimately, transdisciplinary graduate education programs need not only to bridge the divide between disciplines, but also between types of knowledge. Our proposed curriculum aligns well with these needs because it does not sacrifice depth for breadth, and it emphasizes collaboration and communication among diverse groups of students, in addition to development of their individual knowledge and skills.","2014-08","2020-11-17 20:35:21","2023-12-07 17:41:55","","1047–1051","","5","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Oxford University Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7N24V77B/Ciannelli et al. - 2014 - Transdisciplinary graduate education in marine res.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MMEKXCK7/648379.html","","Staff; no acknowledgment; F:Facilitating Interdisciplinary Socio-Environmental Science & Teams; F:Support for Teaching & Training; T:Education/Pedagogy; T:Ocean & Marine Life; 2014; K:training; K:curriculum; K:graduate eduction; K:marine science; K:trandisciplinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, estimates of contact between animals are notoriously difficult to acquire. Researchers commonly use telemetry technologies to identify animal associations, but such data may have different sampling intervals and often captures a small subset of the population. The objectives of this study were to outline best practices for telemetry sampling in network studies of infectious disease by determining (a) the consequences of telemetry sampling on our ability to estimate network structure, (b) whether contact networks can be approximated using purely spatial contact definitions and (c) how wildlife spatial configurations may influence telemetry sampling requirements. We simulated individual movement trajectories for wildlife populations using a home range-like movement model, creating full location datasets and corresponding ‘complete’ networks. To mimic telemetry data, we created ‘sample’ networks by subsampling the population (10%–100% of individuals) with a range of sampling intervals (every minute to every 3 days). We varied the definition of contact for sample networks, using either spatiotemporal or spatial overlap, and varied the spatial configuration of populations (random, lattice or clustered). To compare complete and sample networks, we calculated seven network metrics important for disease transmission and assessed mean ranked correlation coefficients and percent error between complete and sample network metrics. Telemetry sampling severely reduced our ability to calculate global node-level network metrics, but had less impact on local and network-level metrics. Even so, in populations with infrequent associations, high intensity telemetry sampling may still be necessary. Defining contact in terms of spatial overlap generally resulted in overly connected networks, but in some instances, could compensate for otherwise coarse telemetry data. By synthesizing movement and disease ecology with computational approaches, we characterized trade-offs important for using wildlife telemetry data beyond ecological studies of individual movement, and found that careful use of telemetry data has the potential to inform network models. Thus, with informed application of telemetry data, we can make significant advances in leveraging its use for a better understanding and management of wildlife infectious disease.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:30:05","2023-12-07 17:41:55","","76-87","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TXX45FVW/Gilbertson et al. - 2021 - Trade-offs with telemetry-derived contact networks.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5YHBBLN7/2041-210X.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Vulnerability; T:Disease & Pests; 2018PF-040; K:disease modeling; K:disease ecology; K:social network analysis; K:network structure; K:spatial overlap; K:telemetry sampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the United States, a declining trend was reversed by the turn of the century, but high volatility at the river basin scale threatens continued monitoring in over a quarter of the river basins of the conterminous United States.

Most studies are not designed to tease out the direct and indirect effects of climate at various stages along the migration route. We assess the impacts of spring and summer climate conditions on breeding monarch butterflies, a species that completes its annual migration cycle over several generations. No single, broad-scale climate metric can explain summer breeding phenology or the substantial year-to-year fluctuations observed in population abundances. As such, we built a Poisson regression model to help explain annual arrival times and abundances in the Midwestern United States. We incorporated the climate conditions experienced both during a spring migration/breeding phase in Texas as well as during subsequent arrival and breeding during the main recruitment period in Ohio. Using data from a state-wide butterfly monitoring network in Ohio, our results suggest that climate acts in conflicting ways during the spring and summer seasons. High spring precipitation in Texas is associated with the largest annual population growth in Ohio and the earliest arrival to the summer breeding ground, as are intermediate spring temperatures in Texas. On the other hand, the timing of monarch arrivals to the summer breeding grounds is not affected by climate conditions within Ohio. Once in Ohio for summer breeding, precipitation has minimal impacts on overall abundances, whereas warmer summer temperatures are generally associated with the highest expected abundances, yet this effect is mitigated by the average seasonal tem-perature of each location in that the warmest sites receive no benefit of above-average summer temperatures. Our results highlight the complex relationship between climate and performance for a migrating species and suggest that attempts to understand how monarchs will be affected by future climate conditions will be challenging.","2012-05","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:41:54","","3039–3049","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","71 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZJEV6YJJ/Zipkin et al. - 2012 - Tracking climate impacts on the migratory monarch .pdf","","no acknowledgment; Year 1; T:Climate Change; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; Workshop; T:Ecology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2012W-002; 2012; K:phenology; K:animal migration; K:breeding habitat; K:drought index; K:growing degree day","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, scholarly knowledge of the factors that drive such transitions is lacking, in part due to the dearth of comparative analyses in the existing transitions literature. This study seeks to identify common factors associated with transitions toward sustainability in urban water systems by comparing transitions in three cases: Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. For each case, we develop a data-driven narrative that integrates case-specific contextual data with standardized, longitudinal metrics of exposures theorized to drive transition. We then compare transitions across cases, focusing on periods of accelerated change (PoACs), to decouple generic factors associated with transition from those unique to individual case contexts. From this, we develop four propositions about transitions toward sustainable urban water management. We find that concurrent exposure to water stress and heightened public attention increases the probability of a PoAC (1), while other factors commonly expected to drive transition (e.g. financial stress) are unrelated (2). Moreover, the timing of exposure alignment (3) and the relationship between exposures and transition (4) may vary according to elements of the system's unique context, including the institutional and infrastructure design and hydro-climatic setting. These propositions, as well as the methodology used to derive them, provide a new model for future research on how cities respond to climate-driven water challenges.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:34:35","2023-12-07 17:41:54","","101967","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/M3CL9HZK/Garcia et al. - 2019 - Towards urban water sustainability Analyzing management transitions in Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.pdf","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Year 4; F:Built Environment; T:Climate Change; T:Sustainability; C:Case Study; 2019; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; K:Socio-hydrology; K:case study; 2014T9-007; K:water supply; K:city","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, plants, and pathogens evolved in unique regional assemblages, largely isolated from other assemblages by geographical barriers. When barriers are broken, non-indigenous pathogenic organisms are introduced into new environments, potentially finding suitable hosts lacking resistance genes and environments favouring pathogenic behavior; this process may result in epidemics of newly emerging diseases. Biological invasions are tightly linked to human activities and have been a constant feature throughout human history.

Changing human values play a key role in the emergence of these phenomena and should therefore be considered as internal to the system. Guidance is provided for the framing and modeling of these phenomena to test alternative hypotheses about how they arose. A plurality of coevolutionary models, from stylized to comprehensive system-of-system models, may assist strategic water management for long time scales through facilitating stakeholder participation, exploring the possibility space of alternative futures, and helping to synthesize the observed dynamics in a wide range of case studies.

Studies attempting to isolate the effects of altered habitat configuration on associated communities have reported variable results. This variability may be explained in part by the fragmentation threshold hypothesis, which predicts that the effects of habitat configuration may only manifest at low levels of remnant habitat area. To separate the effects of habitat area and configuration on biodiversity, we surveyed fish communities in seagrass landscapes spanning a range of total seagrass area (2–74% cover within 16,000-m2 landscapes) and spatial configurations (1–75 discrete patches). We also measured variation in fine-scale seagrass variables, which are known to affect faunal community composition and may covary with landscape-scale features. We found that species richness decreased and the community structure shifted with increasing patch number within the landscape, but only when seagrass area was low (\textless25% cover). This pattern was driven by an absence of epibenthic species in low-seagrass-area, highly patchy landscapes. Additional tests corroborated that low movement rates among patches may underlie loss of vulnerable taxa. Fine-scale seagrass biomass was generally unimportant in predicting fish community composition. As such, we present empirical support for the fragmentation threshold hypothesis and we suggest that poor matrix quality and low dispersal ability for sensitive taxa in our system may explain why our results support the hypothesis, while previous empirical work has largely failed to match predictions.","2016-08","2020-11-17 20:35:14","2023-12-07 17:41:53","","2157–2166","","8","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Z64WGUAM/Yeager et al. - 2016 - Threshold effects of habitat fragmentation on fish.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; 2016; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; K:spatial ecology; 2014PF-015; K:landscape ecology; K:species richness; K:seagrass; K:species–area relationship; K:fragmentation; K:community structure; K:fish; K:habitat patch; K:species traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, major gaps remain in our understanding of how relationships between biodiversity and geodiversity vary over space and time. Biodiversity data are globally sparse and concentrated in particular regions. In contrast, many forms of geodiversity can be measured continuously across the globe with satellite remote sensing. Satellite remote sensing directly measures environmental variables with grain sizes as small as tens of meters and can therefore elucidate biodiversity–geodiversity relationships across scales. Evidence: We show how one important geodiversity variable, elevation, relates to alpha, beta, and gamma taxonomic diversity of trees across spatial scales. We use elevation from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and c. 16,000 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots to quantify spatial scaling relationships between biodiversity and geodiversity with generalized linear models (for alpha and gamma diversity) and beta regression (for beta diversity) across five spatial grains ranging from 5 to 100 km. We illustrate different relationships depending on the form of diversity; beta and gamma diversity show the strongest relationship with variation in elevation. Conclusion: With the onset of climate change, it is more important than ever to examine geodiversity for its potential to foster biodiversity. Widely available satellite remotely sensed geodiversity data offer an important and expanding suite of measurements for understanding and predicting changes in different forms of biodiversity across scales. Interdisciplinary research teams spanning biodiversity, geoscience and remote sensing are well poised to advance understanding of biodiversity–geodiversity relationships across scales and guide the conservation of nature.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:30:08","2023-12-07 17:41:53","","548–556","","5","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","76 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/S8WNQMGN/Zarnetske et al. - 2019 - Towards connecting biodiversity and geodiversity a.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZBP25NC6/geb.html","","no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; T:Ecology; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:remote sensing; 2018PF-041; K:scale; K:geodiversity; K:biodiversity metrics; K:elevation; K:satellite","","Thomas Gillespie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we provide a global assessment of biofuel crop production, reconstruct global patterns of biofuel crop/oil trade and determine the associated displacement of water and land use. We find that bioethanol is mostly produced with domestic crops while 36% of biodiesel consumption relies on international trade, mainly from Southeast Asia. Altogether, biofuels rely on about 2-3% of the global water and land used for agriculture, which could feed about 30% of the malnourished population.

Here, we integrate global data on bird communities with comprehensive information on traits associated with ecological processes to show that assemblages in highly urbanised environments have substantially different functional composition and 20% less functional diversity on average than surrounding natural habitats. These changes occur without significant decreases in functional dissimilarity between species; instead, they are caused by a decrease in species richness and abundance evenness, leading to declines in functional redundancy. The reconfiguration and decline of native functional diversity in cities are not compensated by the presence of exotic species but are less severe under moderate levels of urbanisation. Thus, urbanisation has substantial negative impacts on functional diversity, potentially resulting in impaired provision of ecosystem services, but these impacts can be reduced by less intensive urbanisation practices.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:30:03","2023-12-07 17:41:52","","962-972","","6","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","87 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5P5E7IMU/Sol et al. - 2020 - The worldwide impact of urbanisation on avian func.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WXYC8ZPP/ele.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 5; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; 2020; 2015PF-020; wrong DBI; K:functional diversity; K:birds; K:Watershed; K:urbanization; K:species traits; K:redundancy","","David Storch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bed bugs pose significant public health and economic concerns, but cities have been hampered in their response by the ambiguity of current public health and housing regulations toward bed bugs. In this study, I analyze municipal ordinances for more than 8,000 local governments, describe the responses of cities to the bed bug crisis, and examine the different approaches that cities have taken and the political–ecological processes underpinning these varying approaches. Few municipalities have addressed bed bugs in their codes. Most cities that have addressed bed bugs have sought to clarify that bed bugs are to be treated like other pests but, rather than crafting policies specific to bed bugs, have relied on existing code enforcement procedures. Only a handful of U.S. cities have taken a comprehensive approach to addressing the bed bug epidemic. Interests representing apartment owners have pushed back strongly against municipal and state action, complicating the response. It is still too early, and monitoring data are insufficient, to conclusively evaluate the success of municipal ordinances, but I describe potentially successful approaches based on considerations of public health response to infectious disease. Takeaway for practice: Because human dwellings are the habitat of bed bugs, infestations are intimately tied to issues of housing affordability, insecurity and quality, eviction, and mobility. Cities should consider passing ordinances that specifically recognize bed bugs in the sections of their code that address public health, property maintenance, and landlord–tenant rights and responsibilities. Ordinances should be tailored to the specific challenges in addressing bed bug infestations and should include provisions for tenant protection, enforcement, and monitoring.","2019-05","2020-11-17 20:34:41","2023-12-07 17:41:52","","1–18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Routledge","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Y9RN68H6/Schneider - 2019 - They’re Back.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SVFE3DG4/01944363.2019.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; 2019; Year 6; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Vulnerability & Risk; 2016C13-005; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:bed bugs; K:political ecology; K:housing; K:landlord; K:ordinances; K:tenant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a socioeconomic perspective, these gardens also build trust, facilitate participation, improve responses to natural disasters and food security – all vital components of effective adaptation and resilience to climate change. Yet, our qualitative analysis of 18 policy documents for Baltimore, Chicago, and New York City, U.S.A, found that green infrastructure to improve climate change adaptation prioritizes rain gardens, bioswales, and green roofs, but seldom acknowledge the role of community gardens.

The core literature on land and water grabbing is reviewed and systematized using the 17 SDGs as a framework, in order to highlight the relationship between LSLAs and the sustainable development agenda. The magnitude of the global land rush phenomenon and the criticism raised in scholarly research highlight the controversial role that transnational land acquisitions may be playing in the global development agenda.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:52","","120–128","","","26-27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","67 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XTSQUJBY/Dell’Angelo et al. - 2017 - Threats to sustainable development posed by land a.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CCDQS646/S1877343517301756.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; T:Human Geography; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Agriculture; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2014PF-012; K:rural; K:Sustainable Development Goals; K:land acquisition; K:justice; K:land grab; K:livelihood; K:small-scale farm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, large-scale land acquisitions have drastically expanded; it is unclear whether the commons are a preferential target of these acquisitions. Here we argue that the contemporary global “land rush” could be happening at the expense of common-property systems around the world. While there is evidence that common-property systems have developed traditional institutions of resource governance that make them robust with respect to endogenous forces (e.g., uses by community members), it is less clear how vulnerable these arrangements are to exogenous drivers of globalization and expansion of transnational land investments. In common-property systems, farmers and local users may be unable to defend their customary rights and successfully compete with external actors. We define the notion of “commons grabbing” and report on an exploratory study that applied meta-analytical methods, drawing from the recent literature on large-scale land acquisitions and land grabbing. Informed by political economy and political ecology approaches, we coded selected cases on the basis of acquisition mechanisms, claims and property rights, changes in production system, and coercive dynamics, and explored the interactions between the different variables using association tests and qualitative comparative analysis. We found that the majority of the cases included in this analysis (44 of 56) could be examples of commons grabbing.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:41:51","","1–12","","","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","161 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9BIM68JB/Dell’Angelo et al. - 2017 - The Tragedy of the Grabbed Commons Coercion and D.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/57JFMK6Y/S0305750X15310445.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Year 4; 2017; T:Social Science; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; K:commons; Fellow; 2014PF-012; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; T:Political Science; K:land grabbing; K:smallholders; K:coercion; K:common property systems; K:communities; K:large-scale land acquisitions; K:political economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge, therefore, lies in implementing projects that achieve national or regional development goals while also generating positive social and economic outcomes for displaced populations. This paper uses a longitudinal, mixed-methods design to understand the short-term changes in wealth and subjective well-being of households displaced due to construction of the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon. The households were compensated by either cash or credit for their lost land and assets, and were then responsible for finding and purchasing new property. Using pre- and post-displacement household survey and semi-structured interview data, as well as data from a small comparison group, I find that wealth increased for the majority of the study population and that socioeconomic inequality decreased, as poorer households experienced greater improvements in housing conditions, assets, and property ownership. In addition, subjective well-being improved for most households, particularly among those who did not own land at baseline, those who gained assets such as vehicles, those who remained closer to the original study area, and those who remained in close proximity to other households from the study population. Moving to an urban destination was strongly associated with declines in well-being, as was moving far from family or friends. These results suggest that investing sufficient resources in a compensation-based resettlement program can benefit households displaced by large infrastructure projects in the short term, but additional data collection is needed after the completion of dam construction to determine whether these benefits are sustained over the longer term.","2016-11","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:41:51","","385–400","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","47 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DRCJYDEU/S0305750X15302461.html","","no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; Year 6; 2016; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:Brazil; K:inequality; 2016PF-026; K:development-induced displacement; K:hydroelectric dams; K:subjective well-being; K:wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For seeds, the total dispersal kernel (TDK) describes the combined influence of all primary, secondary and higher-order dispersal vectors on the overall dispersal kernel for a plant individual, population, species or community. Understanding the role of each vector within the TDK, and their combined influence on the TDK, is critically important for being able to predict plant responses to a changing biotic or abiotic environment. In addition, fully characterizing the TDK by including all vectors may affect predictions of population spread. Here, we review existing research on the TDK and discuss advances in empirical, conceptual modelling and statistical approaches that will facilitate broader application. The concept is simple, but few examples of well-characterized TDKs exist. We find that significant empirical challenges exist, as many studies do not account for all dispersal vectors (e.g. gravity, higher-order dispersal vectors), inadequately measure or estimate long-distance dispersal resulting from multiple vectors and/or neglect spatial heterogeneity and context dependence. Existing mathematical and conceptual modelling approaches and statistical methods allow fitting individual dispersal kernels and combining them to form a TDK; these will perform best if robust prior information is available. We recommend a modelling cycle to parameterize TDKs, where empirical data inform models, which in turn inform additional data collection. Finally, we recommend that the TDK concept be extended to account for not only where seeds land, but also how that location affects the likelihood of establishing and producing a reproductive adult, i.e. the total effective dispersal kernel.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:34:34","2023-12-07 17:41:51","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Narnia","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7BVCEXZ3/Rogers et al. - 2019 - The total dispersal kernel a review and future directions.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; 2019; Workshop; T:Ecology; K:species distribution models; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; 2015PF-016; K:global change; 2015PF-017; Year 5 (JZ); Year 5 (NB); K:Plants; K:Dispersal","","Claire Aslan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet confusion remains over the precise nature of adaptation vs. transformation and the specific social network structures that facilitate these processes. Here, we adopt a network perspective to theorize a continuum of structural capacities in social–ecological systems that set the stage for effective adaptation and transformation. We begin by drawing on the resilience literature and the multilayered action situation to link processes of change in social–ecological systems to decision making across multiple layers of rules underpinning societal organization. We then present a framework that hypothesizes seven specific social–ecological network configurations that lay the structural foundation necessary for facilitating adaptation and transformation, given the type and magnitude of human action required. A key contribution of the framework is explicit consideration of how social networks relate to ecological structures and the particular environmental problem at hand. Of the seven configurations identified, three are linked to capacities conducive to adaptation and three to transformation, and one is hypothesized to be important for facilitating both processes. We discuss how our theoretical framework can be applied in practice by highlighting existing empirical examples from related environmental governance contexts. Further extension of our hypotheses, particularly as more data become available, can ultimately help guide the design of institutional arrangements to be more effective at dealing with change.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:41:51","","","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","106 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; K:adaptation; Postdoc; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; 2016PF-023; K:adaptive capacity; K:social-ecological system; K:social network; K:social-ecological network; K:transformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we use an earth system model of intermediate complexity to investigate how deforestation on various spatial scales affects ground temperature, with an em-phasis on the latitudinal temperature response and its underlying mechanisms. Results show that the latitudinal pattern of temperature response depends nonlinearly on the spatial extent of deforestation and the fraction of vegetation change. Compared with regional deforestation, temperature change in global deforestation is greatly amplified in temperate and boreal regions but is dampened in tropical regions. Incremental forest removal leads to increasingly larger cooling in temperate and boreal regions, while the temperature increase saturates in trop-ical regions. The latitudinal and spatial patterns of the temperature response are driven by two processes with competing temperature effects: decrease in absorbed shortwave radiation due to increased albedo and decrease in evapotranspiration. These changes in the surface energy balance reflect the importance of the background cli-mate in modifying the deforestation impact. Shortwave radiation and precipitation have an intrinsic geographical distribution that constrains the effects of biophysical changes and therefore leads to temperature changes that are spatially varying. For example, wet (dry) climate favors larger (smaller) evapotranspiration change; thus, warm-ing (cooling) is more likely to occur. Our analysis reveals that the latitudinal temperature change largely results from the climate conditions in which deforestation occurs and is less influenced by the magnitude of individual biophysical changes such as albedo, roughness, and evapotranspiration efficiency.","2016-03","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:50","","167–181","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; 2016; Fellow; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Law dictates the structure, boundaries, rules, and processes within which governmental action takes place, and in doing so becomes one of the focal points for analysis of barriers to adaptation as the effects of climate change are felt. Adaptive governance must therefore contemplate a level of flexibility and evolution in governmental action beyond that currently found in the heavily administrative governments of many democracies. Nevertheless, over time, law itself has proven highly adaptive in western systems of government, evolving to address and even facilitate the emergence of new social norms (such as the rights of women and minorities) or to provide remedies for emerging problems (such as pollution). Thus, there is no question that law can adapt, evolve, and be reformed to make room for adaptive governance. In doing this, not only may barriers be removed, but law may be adjusted to facilitate adaptive governance and to aid in institutionalizing new and emerging approaches to governance. The key is to do so in a way that also enhances legitimacy, accountability, and justice, or else such reforms will never be adopted by democratic societies, or if adopted, will destabilize those societies. By identifying those aspects of the frameworks for adaptive governance reviewed in the introduction to this special feature relevant to the legal system, we present guidelines for evaluating the role of law in environmental governance to identify the ways in which law can be used, adapted, and reformed to facilitate adaptive governance and to do so in a way that enhances the legitimacy of governmental action.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:41:50","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","57 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; 2017; Pursuit; Year 2; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2013T5-006; K:adaptive governance; K:resilience; K:environmental governance; K:water law; K:administrative law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concomitantly, transformations of the land are the main drivers for the emergence and re-emergence of malaria. An understanding of malaria population dynamics in transforming landscapes is lacking, despite its relevance for developmental and public health policies. We develop a mathematical model that couples malaria epidemiology with the socio-economic and demographic processes that occur in a landscape undergoing land-use change. This allows us to identify different types of malaria dynamics that can arise in early stages of this transformation. In particular, we show that an increase in transmission followed by either a decline, or a further enhancement, of risk is a common outcome. This increase results from the asymmetry between the relatively fast ecological changes in transformed landscapes, and the slower pace of investment in malaria protection. These results underscore the importance of reducing ecological risk, while providing services and economic opportunities to early migrants for longer periods. Consideration of these socio-ecological processes and, more importantly, the temporal scale on which they act, is critical to avoid potential bifurcations that lead to long-lasting endemic malaria.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:41:50","","0108","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; 2017; Year 1; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; Venture; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2012V-009; 2013PF-008; Year 3 (ABC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although unpaved roads are broadly recognized as significant sources of sediment within managed forested landscapes, their role in altering runoff response is characteristically dependent on rainstorm and watershed size. Here we evaluate the role of unpaved roads in the development of Horton overland flow and their potential to influence the delivery of runoff from small watersheds (∼1skm2) drained by ephemeral streams flowing toward coral reef bearing waters of the Northeastern Caribbean. Infiltration capacity curves for undisturbed forest soils and unpaved roads were developed based on hydrologic characterization performed with a Guelph permeameter. Results demonstrate that infiltration capacities from unpaved roads are roughly a quarter of those for forest soils. Consequently, localized precipitation excess is about four times greater on unpaved roads than on forest soils. Analyses indicate that unpaved roads generate precipitation excess roughly ten times more frequently than watershed-scale storm flow generated by the combined effects of precipitation excess and saturation overland flow. Comparison of unpaved road precipitation excess with observed watershed discharge suggests that road networks may produce localized surface runoff equal to 62% of total watershed discharge for rainstorms up to 3.0cm, and this holds even for watersheds with low and moderate road densities (0.8–2.3kmkm−2). For watersheds with high road densities (∼7.6kmkm−2), roads may contribute about one-quarter of storm flow for rain events up to 10cm. Our results stress the high sensitivity of runoff response in dry tropical watersheds to land disturbance, even when this disturbance occurs on only about 1% of the land surface. In this particular case study, unpaved roads prove capable of altering the time distribution of runoff and, by extension, sediment delivery, from one that is naturally infrequent and sporadic to one that is potentially chronic.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:41:50","","168–179","","","533","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","T:Landscapes at Risk; Year 4; no acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; 2016; T:Pollution; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:Coral reefs; 2014PF-014; K:Dry tropics; K:Forest roads; K:Horton overland flow; K:Runoff","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an overview of the history and scope of FLEs. A literature review, questionnaire, expert workshop, and key informant interviews were conducted. A content analysis was performed of the key informant interviews using a grounded theory approach. This paper offers a formal definition of a FLE, describes different configurations of FLEs, discusses the utility, common objectives, and common outcomes of FLEs, and outlines a research agenda for future work on FLEs. Organizers have found FLEs to have four main utilities: 1) FLEs leverage peer-to-peer sharing so that participants open each other's horizons for improving fisheries and fishing 2) FLEs catalyze and speed change, 3) FLEs are good for sharing thoughts that are difficult to receive and accept, 4) FLEs facilitate involvement and commitment from relevant parties needed for change. The most commonly documented purposes of FLEs were related to marine reserves, fisheries management strategies, bycatch reduction, and alternative livelihoods to fishing. The most common objectives among the FLEs surveyed were to encourage action or behavior, to openly exchange ideas, and to introduce new technology. As a result of FLEs the common outcomes were that participants were inspired to make changes, new programs were implemented, relationships were built and connections made, and participants enhanced their understanding of marine management strategies.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:22","2023-12-07 17:41:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2017; no acknowledgment; Year 1; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Workshop; T:Ocean & Marine Life; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Fisheries; 2012W-005; K:Knowledge exchange; K:Marine conservation; K:Fisheries learning exchanges; K:Fisheries management; K:Natural resources management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual mayors, council leaders and powerful municipal officers can exert a major influence on a city's role in environmental matters. However, changes in policy at the national level can abruptly cause programmes to slow down, loose impetus or fail. In the UK, municipal responses to Local Agenda 21 after 1992 depended on whether or not councils were fully committed. As new national priorities emerged, the broad cross-sectoral participation in Local Agenda 21 was lost. New strategies had less outreach to the community. The UK Eco-town programme looked to be ambitious when it was announced, but financial constraints and political changes have led it to become a small scale Eco-community programme of more energy-efficient housing but with few of the originally broad ecological and sustainability goals. Good ideas for urban greenspace have to be fitted into the local political context.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:41:49","","312–319","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] ISBN: 0169-2046","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/24MHADDQ/Douglas - 2014 - The political filter in the local implementation o.pdf","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014; 2012T1-009; T:Political Science; K:Eco-towns; K:Local Agenda 21; K:Political will; K:Urban environmental policy filter; K:Urban human-ecological systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emergence of invasion science out of ecology might explain why interdisciplinarity has remained mostly within the natural sciences. Nevertheless, invasion science is attracting social–ecological collaborations to understand ecological challenges, and to develop novel approaches to address new ideas, concepts, and invasion-related questions between scholars and stakeholders.

In frameworks of adaptive comanagement, the theory of participatory conservation plays a central role in the democratization of decision-making authority and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens. We observe, however, that the institutions of state, society, and economy shape the implementation and application of participation in significant ways across contexts. This paper examines the political ecology of participation by comparing and contrasting discourse and practice in four developed and developing contexts. The cases drawn from Central Asia, Africa, and North America illustrate that institutional dynamics and discourse shape outcomes. While these results are not necessarily surprising, they raise questions about the linkages between participatory conservation theory, policy and programmatic efforts of implementation to achieve tangible local livelihood and conservation outcomes. Participation must be understood in the broader political economy of conservation in which local projects unfold, and we suggest that theories of participatory governance need to be less generalized and more situated within contours of place-based institutional and environmental histories. Through this analysis we illustrate the dialectical process of conservation in that the very institutions that participation is intended to build create resistance, as state control once did. Conservation theory and theories of participatory governance must consider these dynamics if we are to move conservation forward in a way that authentically incorporates local level livelihood concerns.","2015-12","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:41:49","","164–167","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","44 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/52N8PDR9/Bixler et al. - 2015 - The political ecology of participatory conservatio.pdf","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; 2015; Postdoc; T:Conservation; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2014PF-012; T:Political Science; K:environmental governance; K:political ecology; K:Community-based conservation; K:discourse; K:participatory governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our review shows how depoliticization dynamics in co-production reinforce rather than mitigate existing unequal power relations and how they prevent wider societal transformation from taking place.

However, our understanding of when and how abruptly this climate-driven disruption of biodiversity will occur is limited because biodiversity forecasts typically focus on individual snapshots of the future. Here we use annual projections (from 1850 to 2100) of temperature and precipitation across the ranges of more than 30,000 marine and terrestrial species to estimate the timing of their exposure to potentially dangerous climate conditions. We project that future disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt, because within any given ecological assemblage the exposure of most species to climate conditions beyond their realized niche limits occurs almost simultaneously. Under a high-emissions scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5), such abrupt exposure events begin before 2030 in tropical oceans and spread to tropical forests and higher latitudes by 2050. If global warming is kept below 2 °C, less than 2% of assemblages globally are projected to undergo abrupt exposure events of more than 20% of their constituent species; however, the risk accelerates with the magnitude of warming, threatening 15% of assemblages at 4 °C, with similar levels of risk in protected and unprotected areas. These results highlight the impending risk of sudden and severe biodiversity losses from climate change and provide a framework for predicting both when and where these events may occur. Using annual projections of temperature and precipitation to estimate when species will be exposed to potentially harmful climate conditions reveals that disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt and could start as early as the current decade.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:41:49","","496-501","","","580","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","339 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 5; 2020; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; 2015PF-020; T:Disturbance; wrong DBI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While food trade has been the subject of intensive investigations in recent years, food reserves remain poorly quantified. It is unclear how food stocks are changing and whether they are declining. In this study we use food stock records for 92 products to reconstruct 50 years of aggregated food reserves, expressed in caloric equivalent (kcal), at the regional and global scales. A detailed statistical analysis demonstrates that the overall regional and global per-capita food stocks are stationary, challenging a widespread impression that food reserves are shrinking. We develop a statistically-sound stochastic representation of stock dynamics and take the stock-halving probability as a measure of the natural variability of the process. We find that there is a 20% probability that the global per-capita stocks will be halved by 2050. There are, however, some strong regional differences: Western Europe and the region encompassing North Africa and the Middle East have smaller halving probabilities and smaller per-capita stocks, while North America and Oceania have greater halving probabilities and greater per-capita stocks than the global average. Africa exhibits low per-capita stocks and relatively high probability of stock halving by 2050, which reflects a state of higher food insecurity in this continent.","2016-03","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:41:48","2021-11-26 20:11:05","035010","","3","11","","Environ.

These arguments converge demonstrating that rather than water wars in the future, water peace will prevail. While we agree with these arguments on the low likelihood of future water wars, we find that hydropolitical theories have generally neglected the fact that the conditions for interstate water peace come with high socio‐environmental costs. In particular, the central idea that virtual water trade resolve issues of local water scarcity and therefore reduces tensions and escalation of violence among different countries does not fully take into account the fact that dynamics of transnational water appropriation have serious socio‐environmental impacts on the virtual water exporting countries. To conceptualize this phenomenon we introduce the notion of “hidden socio‐environmental costs of virtual water transfer,” which is understood as a specific form of environmental cost‐shifting. The empirical support to our reasoning comes from the study of transnational large‐scale land acquisitions which represent an expanding phenomenon central in the contemporary global agrarian transformation.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:30:28","2023-12-07 17:41:48","","","","6","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DIC3W3W7/Dell'Angelo, D'Odorico, Rulli - 2018 - The neglected costs of water peace.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/F84BUEFJ/Dell'Angelo et al. - 2018 - The neglected costs of water peace.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CMWCVSWA/wat2.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2014PF-012; wrong DBI; T:Political Science; K:cost-shifting; K:virtual water trade; K:water conflict; K:water peace; K:water war","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It focuses on the case of the Justinianic Plague (ca. 541–750 c.e.), the first major recorded plague pandemic in Mediterranean history, which has increasingly been used to explain significant demographic, political, social, economic, and cultural change during late antiquity (ca. 300–800 c.e.). We argue that the Justinianic Plague retains its great historiographic power—namely, its supposed destructive impact over two centuries—because it evokes a terrifying myth of what plague should do rather than because of conclusive evidence of what it did. We define this historiographic power as the plague concept. It includes three key features: extensive chronology (lasting for two centuries), mortality (catastrophic death toll), and geography (global). The plague concept is built on three interdisciplinary types of evidence (here termed truisms): rats, climate, and paleogenetics. Our article traces how scientists constructed the plague concept in the first half of the twentieth century, and how historians entered the discussion in the last third of that century. As historians engaged in Justinianic Plague research, they used the plague concept to frame their arguments without problematizing its presence or contesting features that scientists had constructed decades earlier.","2020-12","2020-12-21 16:32:37","2023-12-07 17:41:47","2020-12-21 16:32:20","1632-1667","","5","125","","The American Historical Review","The justinianic plague and global pandemics","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FSYHPRSI/Eisenberg and Mordechai - 2020 - The Justinianic Plague and Global Pandemics The M.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H98H7I3Y/6040961.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; 2020; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2019PF-045; T:Humanities; Year 9 (LM); 2019PF-046; Year 9 (ME); K:history; K:History of Science; K:Justinianic Plague; K:Late Antiquity; K:Pandemics; K:Plague","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we argue that this paradigm does not fit the evidence. We examine a series of independent quantitative and qualitative datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic and economic trends during this two-century period: Written sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen, ancient DNA, and mortuary archaeology. Individually or together, they fail to support the maximalist paradigm: None has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none supports maximalist reconstructions of late antique plague. Instead of large-scale, disruptive mortality, when contextualized and examined together, the datasets suggest continuity across the plague period. Although demographic, economic, and political changes continued between the 6th and 8th centuries, the evidence does not support the now commonplace claim that the Justinianic Plague was a primary causal factor of them.","2019-12","2020-11-17 20:30:01","2023-12-07 17:41:47","","25546–25554","","51","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","64 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: National Academy of Sciences PMID: 31792176","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ACNEI9V2/Mordechai et al. - 2019 - The Justinianic Plague An inconsequential pandemic.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IEE2AEBY/Mordechai et al. - 2019 - The Justinianic Plague An inconsequential pandemi.pdf; ; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LTTZP5I3/25546.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31792176","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2019PF-045; T:Humanities; Year 9 (LM); 2019PF-046; Year 9 (ME); K:plague; K:Justinianic Plague; K:Late Antiquity; K:first plague pandemic; K:Yersinia pestis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we ask this question: What is the relationship of environmental inequality and histories of segregation? The answer for Baltimore is complex, where past practices of de jure and de facto segregation have created social and environmental legacies that persist on the landscape today. To answer this question, we examine the interactions among past and current environmental injustices in Baltimore from the late 1880s to the present using nearly twenty years of social and environmental justice research from the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), a long-term social–ecological research project. Our research demonstrates that patterns and procedures in the city's early history of formal and informal segregation, followed by “redlining” in the 1930s, have left indelible patterns of social and environmental inequalities. These patterns are manifest in the distribution of environmental disamenities such as polluting industries, urban heat islands, and vulnerability to flooding, and they are also evident in the distribution of environmental amenities such as parks and trees. Further, our work shows how these legacies are complicated by changing perceptions of what counts as an environmental disamenity and amenity. Ultimately, we argue that the interactions among historical patterns, processes, and procedures over the long term are crucial for understanding environmental injustices of the past and present and for constructing sustainable cities for the future.","2017-10","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:47","","524-537","","2","108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","86 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Routledge","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6VQ2WSPS/Grove et al. - 2018 - The Legacy Effect Understanding How Segregation a.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7WVHD9Q6/24694452.2017.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sociology; Postdoc; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Vulnerability; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2017PF-031; K:environmental justice; 2017PF-030; Year 7  (DL); Year 7 (BH); K:Baltimore; K:distributive justice; K:procedural justice; K:segregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These benefits are threatened by climate change, fires, pests and pathogens. To quantify the current value of the flow of ecosystem services from U.S. trees, and the threats they face, we combine macroevolutionary and economic valuation approaches using spatially explicit data about tree species and lineages. We find that the value of five key ecosystem services with adequate data generated by US trees is $114 billion per annum (low: $85 B; high: $137 B; 2010 USD). The non-market value of trees from carbon storage and air pollution removal far exceed their commercial value from wood products and food crops. Two lineages—pines and oaks—account for 42% of the value of these services. The majority of species face threats from climate change, many face increasing fire risk, and known pests and pathogens threaten 40% of total woody biomass. The most valuable US tree species and lineages are among those most threatened by known pests and pathogens, with species most valuable for carbon storage most at risk from increasing fire threat. High turnover of tree species across the continent results in a diverse set of species distributed across the tree of life contributing to ecosystem services in the U.S. The high diversity of taxa across U.S. forests may be important in buffering ecosystem service losses if and when the most valuable lineages are compromised.","2022-04","2022-08-25 19:43:50","2023-12-07 17:41:46","2022-08-25 19:43:50","e0000010","","4","1","","PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","The hidden value of trees","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/UEYNZDXT/Cavender-Bares et al. - 2022 - The hidden value of trees Quantifying the ecosyst.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HYSU4MCI/article.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; Year 2; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Ecosystem Services; Venture; T:Pollution; 2022; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2012V-011; K:Air pollution; K:Forests; K:valuation; K:Air quality; K:Crops; K:Ecosystems; K:Phylogenetic analysis; K:Plant pathogens; K:Trees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regime shifts are predicted to occur when the intensity of some exogenous driver variable, such as temperature, annual harvest rate, or nutrient addition rate, gradually approaches and crosses a threshold value, initiating a transition to an alternative state. However, many driver variables now change rapidly as presses or pulses, not gradually, requiring new conceptual frameworks for understanding and predicting regime shifts. We argue that identifying and controlling regime shifts in response to presses and pulses will require a greater focus on the duration, not just the intensity, of changes in driver variables. In ecosystems with slower dynamics, transitions to an alternative state can take years to decades and as a result, a driver press with an intensity capable of resulting in a regime shift over long time spans may fail to cause a regime shift when applied for shorter durations. We illustrate these ideas using simulations of local-scale alternative stable state models and preliminary evidence from long-term grazing and eutrophication experiments. The simulations also suggest that small changes in the duration of driver presses or pulses can determine whether an ecosystem recovers to its original state. These insights may extend to larger scales. In spatially extended simulations that included patchiness, spatial heterogeneity, and spatial connectivity, all patches recovered to their original state after shorter presses. However, once press duration exceeded a threshold, growing proportions of the landscape shifted to an alternative state as press duration increased. We observed similar patchy transitions in a catchment-scale experiment that reinstated frequent fires approximately halfway through a regime shift from grassland to shrubland, initiated by fire suppression. In both the local- and larger-scale models, the threshold duration needed to elicit regime shifts decreased as press intensity increased or when factors counteracting regime shifts weakened. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that conceptualizing regime shifts as an interactive function of the intensity and duration of driver changes will increase understanding of the varying effects of driver presses, pulses, and cycles on ecosystem dynamics.","2017-05","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:46","","198–218","","2","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; 2017; T:Ecology; Fellow; K:invasive species; T:Disturbance; K:resilience; K:restoration; K:catastrophic shifts; K:alternative stable states; K:bistability; K:critical transitions; K:extreme events; K:non-equilibrium; K:tipping points; K:transience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This pattern is most pronounced in largest protected areas constituting the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. This paper examines whether observed forest loss could be linked to a shift in conservation governance. We wanted to know how cocaine trafficking affects forest conservation governance in Central America's protected areas. To answer this question, we interviewed conservation stakeholders from key institutions at various levels in three drug-trafficking hotspots: Peten, Guatemala, Northeastern Honduras, and the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. We found that, in order to establish and maintain drug transit operations, drug-trafficking organizations directly and indirectly compete with and undermine conservation governance actors and institutions. Drug trafficking impacts conservation governance in three ways: 1) it fuels booms in extractive activities inside protected lands; 2) it undermines long standing conservation coalitions; and 3) it exploits differences in governance models and geography. Narco-related activities undermine traditional forest uses and resource governance, which produce significant social and ecological costs. Nevertheless, some types of conservation models appear more resistant than others. Particularly, participatory governance models can better maintain conservation goals compared to state-managed parks oriented toward strict conservation policies that exclude park residents and neighbors in land and resource management.","2020-07","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:41:46","","","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EQE6A8KG/S0959378019310076.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; Pursuit; Year 5; T:Conservation; 2020; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2015C12-030; K:Environmental governance; K:Protected areas; K:Deforestation; K:Conservation; K:Drug trafficking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, regional estimates of energy availability for nonbreeding ducks are required to determine if sufficient habitat exists for them. I used core sampling to estimate food and energy density in 6 types of water bodies (i.e., actively and passively managed emergent wetlands, playas, small and large reservoirs, and sloughs) in northeastern Colorado, USA, during 3 sampling occasions throughout 2 nonbreeding seasons, 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. Also, I used precise depth measurements to estimate the percentage of each site that was shallow enough to facilitate feeding by dabbling ducks as a way to correct overall energy density to reflect availability to ducks. Emergent wetlands contained the greatest food and energy density, followed by playas and sloughs, and reservoirs contained little food or energy. Fall depletion of food was greatest in actively managed emergent wetlands and spring depletion was greatest in sloughs and passively managed emergent wetlands. Mean percentage of passively managed emergent wetlands, actively managed emergent wetlands, small reservoirs, large reservoirs, and sloughs shallower than 50 cm was 37%, 77%, 10%, 4%, and 83%, respectively. Incorporating these estimates into the energetic carrying capacity model developed by the Playa Lakes Joint Venture for eastern Colorado resulted in a 54% decrease in overall duck energy day estimates, which is below what is needed to support population goals. This research identifies the need for additional wetland restoration in eastern Colorado to meet energy requirements of nonbreeding ducks and provides information to conservation planners to make more informed decisions about the extent and location of wetland restoration activities.","2020-01","2020-11-17 20:30:05","2023-12-07 17:41:46","","436-447","","3","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H8NLLTEJ/Behney - 2020 - The Influence of Water Depth on Energy Availabilit.pdf","","no acknowledgment; Short Course; T:Conservation; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; T:Ecology; Year 6; K:foraging; K:energy; 2017SC-022; K:bioenergetics; K:Colorado; K:dabbling ducks; K:energetic carrying capacity; K:food availability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the evidence for this intervention is mixed. One potential explanation is the variety of ways that greenspace is measured using remotely sensed data. For instance, aggregate measures can be captured from tree, grass, and shrub cover classifications in high-resolution (1 m2) land cover datasets or they can be measured with normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) values from sensors at different resolutions (e.g., 30 m2 or 250 m2). In the current cross-sectional observational study, we tested the relationship between five greenspace measures and third-grade math and reading standardized tests scores in Maryland public schools (n = 668) around schools and in children's neighborhoods. Low- and high-resolution greenspace measures were highly correlated with each other, but moderate-resolution measures were not. Multivariate regression models revealed positive associations between academic performance and low-resolution NDVI measures around schools and in neighborhoods as well as between performance and tree cover in neighborhoods. These effects were attenuated when an understudied confounder in this body of literature was included: population density as a measure of urbanicity. Grass cover showed associations with performance in models adjusted for urbanicity, but the direction of these associations was negative. These findings suggest that the possible association between greenspace and academic performance is complex and tenuous when examined with observational, cross-sectional study designs in limited geographic regions.","2020-03","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:41:45","","","","","195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2017PF-031; K:NDVI; K:Academic performance; K:Confounding; K:Greenspace; K:Remote sensing data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The geographic extent of B. anthracis is poorly understood, despite multi-decade research on anthrax epizootic and epidemic dynamics; many countries have limited or inadequate surveillance systems, even within known endemic regions. Here, we compile a global occurrence dataset of human, livestock and wildlife anthrax outbreaks. With these records, we use boosted regression trees to produce a map of the global distribution of B. anthracis as a proxy for anthrax risk. We estimate that 1.83 billion people (95% credible interval (CI): 0.59–4.16 billion) live within regions of anthrax risk, but most of that population faces little occupational exposure. More informatively, a global total of 63.8 million poor livestock keepers (95% CI: 17.5–168.6 million) and 1.1 billion livestock (95% CI: 0.4–2.3 billion) live within vulnerable regions. Human and livestock vulnerability are both concentrated in rural rainfed systems throughout arid and temperate land across Eurasia, Africa and North America.

Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food‐energy‐water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food‐energy‐water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.","2018-04","2020-11-17 20:35:02","2023-12-07 17:41:45","","456–531","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","365 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/MLZF67BB/D'Odorico et al. - 2018 - The Global Food-Energy-Water Nexus.pdf","","2018; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; 2014PF-012; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2016PF-029; Year 4 (JD); Year 6 (JG); K:Circular Economy; K:FEW Nexus; K:Food Security; K:Food-water nexus; K:Water Security; K:Water Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Likely driven by recent food crises, new bioenergy policies, and financial speculations, this phenomenon has been often investigated from the economic development, human right, land tenure and food security perspectives, while its hydrologic implications have remained understudied. It has been suggested that a major driver of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is the quest for water resources that can be used (locally) to sustain agricultural production in the acquired land. The appropriation of water resources associated with LSLAs has often been termed ‘water grabbing', though to date a formal definition of such a normative and inherently pejorative term is missing. The intrinsic assumption is that the acquisition of water undergoes the same dynamics of unbalanced power relationships that underlie many LSLAs. Here we invoke hydrological theories of “green” and “blue” water flows to stress the extent to which water appropriations are inherently coupled to land acquisitions and specifically focus on blue water. We then propose a formal definition of blue water grabbing based both on biophysical conditions (water scarcity) and ethical implications (human right to food). Blue water grabs are appropriations of irrigation (i.e., blue) water in regions affected by undernourishment and where agricultural production is constrained by blue water availability. We use this framework to provide a global assessment of the likelihood that LSLAs entail blue water grabbing.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:41:45","","276–285","","","143","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","87 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; T:Economics; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Water & People; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2014PF-012; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we use techniques from network science and bibliometrics to evaluate the degree to which this transformation has taken place. By creating networks based on over 3,000 agroecology papers and the roughly 160,000 references they cite, we distinguish the sub-fields (“research fronts”) that made up agroecology in three time intervals: 1982–2004, 2005–2013, and 2014–2018. We also identify the main disciplines from which the research fronts in 2014–2018 drew their supporting knowledge. We suggest that, very broadly, themes in agroecological research include: Ecosystem services; (agro)biodiversity; approaches to agricultural intensification; tropical agroecosystems (particularly coffee); pest and weed management; organic agriculture; cropping systems; system transitions, modeling, and design; climate change adaptation; food sovereignty; education; and the nature and purpose of agroecology itself. Some research fronts mainly cite papers in natural science fields such as ecology, environmental science, agriculture, and entomology. However, others draw upon work in social science areas including development studies, environmental studies, and anthropology. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that agroecology has indeed evolved to possess many of the characteristics of an “ecology of [the entire] food system.” We anticipate that this work will also be of use to those wishing to gain an overview of the field or identify key papers, knowledge gaps, and potential collaborations.","2021-04","2020-12-07 16:26:21","2023-12-07 17:41:44","2021-05-11 16:24:27","551-591","","4","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2020.1845275","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/I623G65G/21683565.2020.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/85WT3LYF/21683565.2020.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/U7AYZ4IL/21683565.2020.html","","no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Agriculture; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2020; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; Year 10; 2020PF-051; K:Agroecology; K:bibliographic coupling; K:bibliometric analysis; K:food systems; K:metaknowledge; K:network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Invaders are difficult to detect on introduction, so prevention remains the preferred strategy for managing the threat of invasions. Propagule pressure has been shown to be a good predictor of invasion risk. Most studies to date, however, link potential invasive species arrivals with indirect measures of propagule pressure such as aggregate trade volumes. This paper estimates propagule pressure using data that measure actual arrivals. Specifically, it uses inspection data that covers almost all U.S. fruit and vegetable imports from 2005–2014 to estimate a logit model of the probability of potential invasive species arrival and expected propagule frequencies for 2,240 commodity/country of origin combinations. Clear patterns in the geographic origin and commodity pathways for potential pests are identified. The average probability of arrival is low, approximately 0.03, but is two to ten times higher for some commodities, most notably herbs. We identify commodities with a high number of expected arrivals due to either a large volume of trade, high interception rates, or a combination of both. Seven of the top ten countries of origin for propagule frequency are from the Western Hemisphere and further trade liberalization within the Western Hemisphere is likely to heighten challenges to enforcement of US phytosanitary standards. Patterns in the data can help identify the commodities and countries of origin in greatest need of technical assistance and guide targeting of surveillance for the pathways of greatest phytosanitary concern.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:41:44","","e0192280","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; Fellow; K:invasive species; T:Disease & Pests; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2012T2-003; K:Caribbean; K:Medical risk factors; K:beans; K:fruits; K:Herbs; K:United States; K:vegetables","","Gao, Yulin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we reviewed well-established literature in the cognitive, social, and learning sciences that connects material artifacts, boundary objects, and model-based reasoning. Second, we conducted an organized reflection (our own model-based reasoning) on the literature. Key findings include identifying the importance of combining a collective negotiation process with iterative individual external representations of the problem. The external representations are partial, temporary constructs that function as boundary negotiating objects, and enable the scaffolding of cognitive interactions between participants, an essential part of generating shared, integrative problem models between interdisciplinary team members.

The drivers and mechanisms underlying the increased dominance of CAM plants and CAM expression (i.e., nocturnal carboxylation) in facultative CAM plants, however, remain poorly understood. We investigated how nutrient and water availability affected competition between Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (a model facultative CAM species) and the invasive C3 grass Bromus mollis that co-occur in California's coastal grasslands. Specifically we investigated the extent to which water stress, nutrients, and competition affect nocturnal carboxylation in M. crystallinum. High nutrient and low water conditions favored M. crystallinum over B. mollis, in contrast to high water conditions. While low water conditions induced nocturnal carboxylation in 9-week-old individuals of M. crystallinum, in these low water treatments, a 66% reduction in nutrient applied over the entire experiment did not further enhance nocturnal carboxylation. In high water conditions M. crystallinum both alone and in association with B. mollis did not perform nocturnal carboxylation, regardless of the nutrient levels. Thus, nocturnal carboxylation in M. crystallinum was restricted by strong competition with B. mollis in high water conditions. This study provides empirical evidence of the competitive advantage of facultative CAM plants over grasses in drought conditions and of the restricted ability of M. crystallinum to use their photosynthetic plasticity (i.e., ability to switch to CAM behavior) to compete with grasses in well-watered conditions. We suggest that a high drought tolerance could explain the increased dominance of facultative CAM plants in a future environment with increased drought and nitrogen deposition, while the potential of facultative CAM plants such as M. crystallinum to expand to wet environments is expected to be limited.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:41:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4VCZJHIL/Yu et al. - 2017 - The effect of nitrogen availability and water cond.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Ecology; Fellow; K:competition; K:California's coastal grasslands; K:crassulacean acid metabolism; K:Mesembryanthemum crystallinum; K:invasive grass; K:nutrient; K:water stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although previous studies have investigated the effect of intra-annual rainfall variability on plant growth and ecosystem dynamics, the impacts of interannual rainfall variability remain understudied. This paper uses satellite data and develops a new mechanistic model to investigate the response of tree–grass composition to increasing interannual rainfall variability in arid to sub-humid ecosystems along the Kalahari Transect in Southern Africa. Both satellite data and model results show that increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations favor deep-rooted trees over shallow-rooted grasses in drier environments (that is, mean annual rainfall, MAP \textless 900–1000 mm) but favor grasses over trees in wetter environments (that is, MAP \textgreater 900–1000 mm). Trees have a competitive advantage over grasses in dry environments because their generally deeper root systems allow them to have exclusive access to the increased deep soil water resources expected to occur in wet years as a result of the stronger interannual rainfall fluctuations. In relatively wet environments, grasses are favored because of their high growth rate that allows them to take advantage of the window of opportunity existing in years with above average precipitation and thus increase fire-induced tree mortality. Thus, under increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations both direct effects on soil water availability and indirect effects mediated by tree–grass interactions and fire dynamics are expected to play an important role in determining changes in plant community composition.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:41:43","","975–988","","5","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer US","","","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Ecology; Fellow; T:Disturbance; K:competition; K:fire; K:growth rate; K:interannual rainfall variability; K:Kalahari Transect; K:root depth; K:tree-grass composition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Germination is an especially vulnerable life history stage for crops. Salt stress reduces a seed’s ability to absorb water (osmotic stress) and causes an ion imbalance within the seed (ionic stress), ultimately inhibiting germination and preventing crop production. Therefore, growing standard crops in the face of SWI can risk crop failure. If alternative crops are more tolerant of osmotic and ionic stress, they may be more suited to withstand SWI. Our objectives were to (1) determine how salt stress (ionic and osmotic stress) and osmotic stress levels affect seed germination in standard and alternative crops in a controlled environment experiment and (2) compare germination rates in the controlled environment with field trials. In our study region of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, standard crop species include corn, soybean, and wheat; alternative species and varieties include sorghum, chloride-excluding soybean, barley, and quinoa. Seeds of these species were germinated under different levels of salt and osmotic stress ranging from 0 to −4 MPa (0–111.1 dS m−1, respectively) by manipulating concentrations of NaCl to alter salt stress and concentrations of polyethylene glycol to alter osmotic stress. Crop species differed greatly in germination tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses, however, there was no significant difference in percent germination between standard and alternative crop species. Standard soybean, chloride-excluding soybean, and quinoa were the only species to germinate in salt stress; standard soybean and chloride-excluding soybean had an equal tolerance during germination at -1.8 MPa (50.0 dS m−1) and quinoa successfully germinated at -0.5 MPa (13.9 dS m−1). However, wheat (standard) and barley (alternative) were the most tolerant of osmotic stress, successfully germinating at -2 MPa (55.6 dS m−1). We also examined germination of sorghum and chloride-excluding soybeans in previously-established field trials for two years on two salt-intruded farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. One of the farms showed greater germination success (measured as seedling emergence) in chloride-excluding soybean than sorghum despite a small difference in salt stress (Δ -0.05 MPa across the field). These results highlight the complexity of understanding how salt stress shapes germination processes in the real world and suggest temporal windows of low and high stress may have long-lasting consequences for crop performance.","2020-09","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2023-12-07 17:41:43","","104254","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Agriculture; 2020; T:Vulnerability; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Disturbance; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:agriculture; K:crops; K:flooding; K:salt water intrusion; K:saltwater intrusion; K:germination; K:salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This uncertainty is important given that the loss of biodiversity often includes losing key ecosystem functions. Few studies have explored the effects of landscape changes on plant functional diversity and evidence so far has shown far more pervasive effects than previously reported by species richness and composition studies. Here we present a review on the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on (1) individual functional traits—related to persistence, dispersal and establishment—and (2) functional diversity. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and propose ways forward. From the literature review we found that studies have largely focused on dispersal traits, strongly impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, while traits related to persistence were the least studied. Furthermore, most studies did not distinguish habitat loss from spatial fragmentation and were conducted at the plot or fragment-level, which taken together limits the ability to generalize the scale-dependency of landscape changes on plant functional diversity. For future work, we recommend (1) clearly distinguishing the effects of habitat loss from those of fragmentation, and (2) recognizing the scale-dependency of predicted responses when functional diversity varies in time and space. We conclude that a clear understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on functional diversity will improve predictions of the resiliency and resistance of plant communities to varying scales of disturbance.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:34:32","2023-12-07 17:41:43","","505-518","","","191","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BLDVMLMK/Zambrano et al. - 2019 - The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on plant functional traits and functional diversity what do we kn.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Resilience; Postdoc; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; 2015PF-016; K:ecosystem functions; 2015PF-017; Year 5 (JZ); Year 5 (NB); 2014PF-015; K:beta diversity; K:functional traits; Year 4 (LY); K:alpha diversity; K:functional homogenization; K:plant communities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

International trade offers an opportunity to relieve pressures on resource depletion and pollution, such as nitrogen (N) pollution, while it poses multiple socioeconomic challenges, such as food availability. To quantify such trade-offs considering the roles of different crop types, we developed a unique crop-specific N budget database and assessed the impacts of the crop trade on multiple sustainability concerns including N pollution caused by crop production, crop land area, independence of food supply, and trade expenditures. We quantified the ""virtual"" N inputs and harvested areas, which are the amount of N inputs and land resources used in exporting countries for China's crop import. In addition, we proposed the concepts of ""alternative"" N inputs and harvested area to quantify the resources needed if imported crops were produced in China. By comparing results from ""alternative"" and ""virtual"" concepts, we assessed the role of trade in Chinese crops over the past 30 years (i.e., 1986-2015) in alleviating N pollution and saving cropland in China and the world. Crop imports accounted for 31% of Chinese crop N consumption in 2015, and these crop imports eased the need for an additional cropland area of 62 million ha. It also avoided an N surplus by 56 and 36 Tg (Tg = 109 kg) for China and the world respectively but led to $621 billion crop trade expenditures over the 30-year period. The N pollution damage avoided by crop imports in economic terms was priced at $22 ±16 billion in 2015, which is lower than the crop trade expenditures but may be surpassed in the future with the development of the Chinese economy. Optimizing a crop trade portfolio can shift domestic production from N-intensive crop production (e.g., maize, fruits, and vegetables) to N-efficient crop production (e.g., soybeans), and consequently mitigate an N surplus by up to 12%. Improving N use efficiency for individual crops can further increase the mitigation potential of N surplus to 30-50%, but requires technology advancement and policy incentives.","2019-08","2020-11-17 20:30:11","2023-12-07 17:41:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9RVMEAMZ/Huang et al. - 2019 - The environmental and socioeconomic trade-offs of importing crops to meet domestic food demand in China.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; T:Economics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2019; Year 7; 2017C17-025; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:sustainability; K:nitrogen pollution; K:crop portfolio optimization; K:crop trade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article reconstructs the council's dramatic, complicated, and highly orchestrated two days of discussion. The bishops spent day one re-stating Boniface's basis of authority and assembling earlier canons into precedents to confirm his power. On day two, the bishops heard a complex jurisdictional case involving a certain Abbot Peter and his monastery, which Boniface used to confirm the power the council had granted him. When this council is discussed, Abbot Peter's case is stripped from its context as a simple precedent for medieval privileges and immunities. I demonstrate how Merovingian Gallic bishops made the council into a precedent by ignoring Boniface's goals. Notably, the article illustrates how a North African late antique bishop's attempt to expand his power outside of state support became an ideal way for early medieval Gallic bishops to claim continuity with the past that actually created a break in their present.","2020-11","2020-11-25 15:14:12","2023-12-07 17:41:42","2020-11-25 15:14:12","258-284","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SDYDJWHF/Project MUSE - The Council of Carthage of 525 and .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2G8I2B8K/Eisenberg - 2020 - The Council of Carthage of 525 and the Making of P.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2020; Year 9; K:historians; T:Humanities; 2019PF-046; K:history","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While such assessments are useful to establish specific benchmarks, and for measuring progress toward sustainability and resilience goals, they do not motivate, or support the innovations required to provide specific ecosystem services as an intentional part of routine urban and infrastructure development activity by municipalities and professionals. In this context, predictions for unprecedented future urbanization and development of new urban infrastructure represent a unique opportunity to “learn-by-doing”. Significant advances in urban sustainability have recently been made through transdisciplinary collaborations among researchers, professionals, decision-makers and stakeholders. However, these advances, often through pilot projects, have limited transferability to other cities due to the inherent biophysical and cultural uniqueness of the city in which they originated, and of the projects and plans themselves. The promise of practicing “learning-by-doing”, therefore, remains an elusive goal, not yet fully integrated with urban development. In this essay, a framework for “safe to fail” adaptive urban design is proposed to integrate science, professional practice, and stakeholder participation. The framework is a transdisciplinary working method, and includes experimental design guidelines, monitoring and assessment protocols and strategies for realizing specific urban ecosystem services integral with urban development. The “safe-to-fail” adaptive urban design framework encourages and rewards innovation in a low-risk context – while assessing the achievement and performance of the specific intended ecosystem services.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:41:42","","254–259","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","284 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","T:Resilience; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Actionable Research; 2014; 2012T1-009; K:Ecosystem services; K:Adaptive design; K:Citizen science; K:Learning by doing; K:Performance indicators; K:Transdisciplinarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biodiversity conservation may help increase carbon storage, but the value of this influence has been difficult to assess. We use plant, soil, and ecosystem carbon storage data from two grassland biodiversity experiments to show that greater species richness increases economic value: Increasing species richness from 1 to 10 had twice the economic value of increasing species richness from 1 to 2. The marginal value of each additional species declined as species accumulated, reflecting the nonlinear relationship between species richness and plant biomass production. Our demonstration of the economic value of biodiversity for enhancing carbon storage provides a foundation for assessing the value of biodiversity for decisions about land management.

We find that daily and annual flows are dominated by red and white spectra respectively, and spatial variation in noise color is explained by a combination of geographic, hydroclimatic, and anthropogenic variables. Noise color at the daily scale is influenced by stream network position, and land use and water management explain around one third of the spatial variation in noise color irrespective of the timescale considered.

In the neotropics, such deposits represent opportunities for preservation in otherwise challenging tropical climates. The Caribbean island of Trinidad contains the largest natural asphalt deposit in the world and has a fragmentary record of brief excavations in the early-mid 1900s. We integrated information from collections databases with archival research and field surveys to verify localities, reconstruct taphonomic scenarios, and compile the first comprehensive Pleistocene faunal record for terrestrial Trinidad. To guide interpretations of this poorly sampled region, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of megafaunal mammal abundance data from all known “tar pits” of the western hemisphere, including metrics for sampling coverage and ecological diversity. Based on these metrics, condition of skeletal material, and descriptions of geology, we suggest that the megafaunal remains from Trinidadian localities represent secondary asphaltic preservation, in which hydrocarbons infiltrated in-situ Pleistocene bone beds, thus guiding future excavation approaches. The orders Cingulata, Pilosa, Proboscidea and Rodentia are represented, with genera that are ecologically consistent with the former savanna connection of Trinidad and Venezuela. Using this information, we infer the Quaternary biogeographic and paleoenvironmental history of Trinidad and demonstrate sized-biased extinctions. Finally, we identify interdisciplinary opportunities to study the actualistic taphonomy and ecology of active asphalt seeps today.

This approach allows us to draw inferences about different pathways through the precipitation-production causal chain and to link changes in precipitation with impacts on farm profits and welfare. We find that production and production efficiency are affected by green and blue water and that reductions in rainfall will have negative impacts that may disproportionally impact the poor.

Data on how these traits vary among species and populations are fundamental to our understanding of the ecological conditions that have shaped plant evolution. Because these demographic schedules determine population growth or decline, such data help us understand how different biomes shape plant ecology, how plant populations and communities respond to global change and how to develop successful management tools for endangered or invasive species.     Matrix population models summarize the life cycle components of survival, growth and reproduction, while explicitly acknowledging heterogeneity among classes of individuals in the population. Matrix models have comparable structures, and their emergent measures of population dynamics, such as population growth rate or mean life expectancy, have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among populations and species.     Thousands of plant matrix population models have been parameterized from empirical data, but they are largely dispersed through peer-reviewed and grey literature, and thus remain inaccessible for synthetic analysis.

The total area in RPAs and the impacts of changes in the BFC on RPA requirements are uncertain due to lack of clarity about how RPAs are defined in practice. We reconstruct the history of the RPA rule, use a recent cadastral database (CAR) of the state of Rondônia to quantify the area of RPA by stream size and to document the impact of the 2012 changes in RPA requirements, and review the literature on hydrological ecosystem services (HES) in light of RPA rules. We find that most (64%) of the area in RPAs in the state of Rondônia was illegally deforested by 2017, and the 2012 regulations require restoration of only half of that cleared area. Most of the RPA is located along small streams (< 10 m wide) that were typically missing in previous assessments. As of 2017, 66% of the RPA along small streams was deforested, while most (70–95%) RPA along large streams (> 200 m wide) was forested. Current restoration requirements (5 m regardless of stream width) for very small properties (< 60 ha) are likely inadequate to restore HES.

This is particularly relevant to the illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products, both flora and fauna. Driven by dynamics of consumer demand and illicit supply, mitigation of illegal trade requires a fuller appreciation of human behaviour and methods to change it. In various sectors, social influence, behavioural insights, social marketing and human-centred approaches trend towards mainstream practice and policy application.

Ensuring joint food-water security has prompted efforts to quantify freshwater use for different food products and production methods. However, few analyses quantify freshwater use for seafood production, and those that do use inconsistent water accounting. This inhibits water use comparisons among seafood products or between seafood and agricultural/livestock products. This ‘seafood gap' in the food-water nexus literature will become increasingly problematic as seafood consumption is growing globally and aquaculture is one of the fastest growing animal food sectors in the world. Therefore, the present study 1) reviews freshwater use concepts as they relate to seafood production; 2) provides three cases to highlight the particular water use concerns for aquaculture, and; 3) outlines future directions to integrate seafood into the broader food-water nexus discussion. By revisiting water use concepts through a focus on seafood production systems, we highlight the key water use processes that should be considered for seafood production and offer a fresh perspective on the analysis of freshwater use in food systems more broadly.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:41:40","","505-514","","","110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LTVL4KGP/S0309170817302488.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Postdoc; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; K:aquaculture; K:Fisheries; K:Food-water nexus; K:Freshwater use assessment; K:Impact assessment methodology; K:Water footprint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the timing and effects of this change in behavior on the ecosystem are largely unknown. Using titanium from XRF analysis, loss-on-ignition (LOI), fossil pollen, Sporormiella, and charcoal, we present a high-resolution 12,000-yr paleoecological history of Lake Llaviucu, a mid-elevation lake in the Ecuadorian Andes. For the entire period of study, humans were active in this landscape, with signs of agropastoralism being present since c. 6100 cal yr BP. Apparent ENSO activity, inferred from titanium inputs to the sediment is also heightened at c. 6100 cal yr BP. A trajectory of increasing landuse seems to have peaked in terms of maize production between c. 2900 and 800 cal yr BP. Thereafter, larger abundances of Sporormiella spores suggest that pastoralism was of increasing importance; a pattern disrupted by European arrival. Apparent peaks in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) appears to be linked to fire and maize frequency. We investigated the relationship between the Lake Llaviucu record and that of nearby Lake Pallcacocha, which is often cited as providing a regional ENSO history.","2020-09","2020-11-17 20:29:59","2023-12-07 17:41:40","","","","","243","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Z2HDHTQS/S0277379120304339.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; Year 8; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; 2018PF-044; 2020; T:Environmental History; K:Paleoecology; K:Domestication; K:El Niño Southern Oscillation; K:Human settlement; K:Maize; K:Mid-holocene dry event; K:Pollen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly generating datasets that are worth more than their component parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise dissimilarities between countries’ pathogen communities and pathogens’ geographical distributions and uses these to predict country–pathogen associations. We compare the success rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g. virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model is able to use the information on the existing country–pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly well, suggesting the importance in considering information on co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.","2019-11","2020-11-17 20:30:06","2023-12-07 17:41:40","","190883","","11","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Royal Society","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IRX59JCC/Dallas et al. - Testing predictability of disease outbreaks with a.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 8; K:community ecology; T:Risk; T:Disease & Pests; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:emerging infectious disease; K:community dissimilarity; 2018PF-057; K:pathogen biogeography; K:disease forecasting; Y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three simulations provide a comparison of the combined effects on toxic releases and employment of management strategies targeted at major polluters versus strategies that encompass a random or median subset of facilities or industries. Targeted strategies are effective because toxic emissions are highly disproportionally distributed. A handful of facilities and industries account for the majority of toxic hazard released in the US manufacturing sector. Moreover, these highly polluting facilities and industries do not employ significantly more workers than peer, lower polluting facilities and industries. The research challenges the narrative that protecting the environment must come at a significant cost to economic activity.

At the same time, cumulative local land changes are driving global and regional changes in biodiversity and the environment. To understand the causes and consequences of these changes, land change science (LCS) draws on a wide array of synthetic and meta-study techniques to generate global and regional knowledge from local case studies of land change. Here, we review the characteristics and applications of synthesis methods in LCS and assess the current state of synthetic research based on a meta-analysis of synthesis studies from 1995 to 2012. Publication of synthesis research is accelerating, with a clear trend toward increasingly sophisticated and quantitative methods, including meta-analysis. Detailed trends in synthesis objectives, methods, and land change phenomena and world regions most commonly studied are presented. Significant challenges to successful synthesis research in LCS are also identified, including issues of interpretability and comparability across case-studies and the limits of and biases in the geographic coverage of case studies. Nevertheless, synthesis methods based on local case studies will remain essential for generating systematic global and regional understanding of local land change for the foreseeable future, and multiple opportunities exist to accelerate and enhance the reliability of synthetic LCS research in the future.

This presents an opportunity to use the H exponent as an index for the classification of catchments on a scale from natural to urbanised conditions. However, before using the H exponent as a general index, the relationship between this exponent and level of urbanisation needs to be further examined and verified on catchments with different levels of imperviousness and from different climatic regions. In this study, the H exponent is estimated for 38 (deseasonalised) mean daily runoff time series, 22 from the USA and 16 from Australia, using the traditional rescaled-range statistic (R∕S) and the more advanced multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Relationships between H and catchment imperviousness, catchment size, annual rainfall and specific mean discharge were investigated. No clear relationship with catchment area was found, and a weak negative relationship with annual rainfall and specific mean streamflow was found only when the R∕S method was used. Conversely, both methods showed decreasing values of H as catchment imperviousness increased. The H exponent decreased from around 1.0 for catchments in natural conditions to around 0.6 for highly urbanised catchments. Three significantly different ranges of H exponents were identified, allowing catchments to be parsed into groups with imperviousness lower than 5% (natural), catchments with imperviousness between 5 and 15% (peri-urban) and catchments with imperviousness larger than 15% (urban). The H exponent thus represents a useful metric to quantitatively assess the impact of catchment imperviousness on streamflow regime.","2018-06","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:41:39","","3551–3559","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YU6NK6M2/Jovanovic et al. - 2018 - Technical note Long-term persistence loss of urba.pdf","","2018; no acknowledgment; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Disturbance; 2017PF-035","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we evaluate four regional scenario assessments: first, to explore a number of research challenges related to sustainability science and, second, to contribute to sustainability research in the specific case studies. The four case studies used commonly applied scenario approaches that are (i) a story and simulation approach with stakeholder participation in the Oum Zessar watershed, Tunisia, (ii) a participatory scenario exploration in the Rwenzori region, Uganda, (iii) a model-based prepolicy study in the Inner Niger Delta, Mali, and (iv) a model coupling-based scenario analysis in upper Thukela basin, South Africa. The scenario assessments are evaluated against a set of known challenges in sustainability science, with each challenge represented by two indicators, complemented by a survey carried out on the perception of the scenario assessments within the case study regions. The results show that all types of scenario assessments address many sustainability challenges, but that the more complex ones based on story and simulation and model coupling are the most comprehensive. The study highlights the need to investigate abrupt system changes as well as governmental and political factors as important sources of uncertainty. For an in-depth analysis of these issues, the use of qualitative approaches and an active engagement of local stakeholders are suggested. Studying ecological thresholds for the regional scale is recommended to support research on regional sustainability. The evaluation of the scenario processes and outcomes by local researchers indicates the most transparent scenario assessments as the most useful. Focused, straightforward, yet iterative scenario assessments can be very relevant by contributing information to selected sustainability problems.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:39","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; Year 2; C:Case Study; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:Africa; 2013T5-006; K:sustainability science; K:global and regional change; K:integrated assessments; K:participatory research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of urban ecological research done describes European and North American cities. South Africa's position in the global South underlines the potential that local research has in contributing to global knowledge. South African urban landscapes are rich in biodiversity and characterized by cultural diversity and steep socio-economic gradients. Spatial inequality, specifically access to resources and green areas, greatly influences the perceived importance and need of urban green space to citizens and policy makers. This legacy is a major challenge to the implementation of sustainability oriented contemporary urban planning and environmental management practices in South Africa. Sustainable solutions call for transdisciplinary approaches, in which the contributions of both non-academic and academic role players are integrated. Therefore, we investigated the possible interface between urban ecology, urban planning, and environmental management, within current policy and legislation frameworks and within practice in South Africa. We highlight certain aspects of the three disciplines that could contribute to transdisciplinary planning approaches, such as mapping and valuation of ecosystem services, strategic and integrated thinking, prediction and scenario building, governance, and decision-making and participatory planning. We believe that awareness of the major contributions of each discipline would refine the linkages between social and ecological issues proposed by several existing conceptual frameworks, leading to a transdisciplinary approach to plan for sustainable urban landscapes. The South African perspective presented in this paper could guide other (similar) global scenarios with regard to transdisciplinary planning approaches that could enhance the development of sustainable urban landscapes.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:41:38","","260–270","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BMTAGPPE/Cilliers et al. - 2014 - Sustainable urban landscapes South African perspe.pdf","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; T:Sustainability; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Team Science & Collaborations; 2014; 2012T1-009; K:Urban ecology; K:Environmental management; K:Sustainable development; K:Transdisciplinary approach; K:Urban planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Last year, as the country watched the tragic Flint, Michigan tap water quality deterioration unfold, the issue was brought closer to home: How good is Baltimore's water system? Baltimore's water source is primarily surface water, which feeds into the Liberty, Loch Raven and Prettyboy reservoirs. The Socio-Environmental Synthesis (SES) approach was used to investigate the factors that contribute to water quality impairment. SES is a research method that integrates existing knowledge and data from natural and social sciences to advance understanding of socio-environmental systems. The study found out that while the quality of the drinking water is generally good, there is a growing concern with the quality of water in the watersheds. The high levels of nitrate-nitrogen and increased concentrations of carbon dioxide are especially alarming. The high levels of Biological Oxygen Demand are also good indicators of the intensity of agriculture and urbanization in the watersheds. This study believes that maximizing the current watershed conservation and restoration efforts would reduce the treatment costs and safeguard the urban water supplies.","2017-06","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:41:38","","32","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; no acknowledgment; C:Case Study; Short Course; T:Synthesis Research; F:Water & People; T:Pollution; T:Vulnerability; T:Human Health & Well-Being; K:Water quality; K:socio-environmental synthesis; K:Watershed; K:Baltimore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We introduce a new decision framework, eco-engineering decision scaling (EEDS), that explicitly and quantitatively explores trade-offs in stakeholder-defined engineering and ecological performance metrics across a range of possible management actions under unknown future hydrological and climate states. We illustrate its potential application through a hypothetical case study of the Iowa River, USA.

Basin scale sustainability is defined as a function of economic growth, provision of environmental services and equality within the basin. The analysis reveals that a diversified basin economy is important to achieve sustainable development. Under current climate conditions, a higher level of diversification in the basin's economy increases sustainability. Higher current capital growth rates, e.g., >2% of the current rate, would also lead to more sustainable development of a kind that is less affected by the availability of water and robust to vagaries of climate change.

International markets can provide higher revenues that benefit small-scale fishing communities but can also drive a decline in fished populations. Collective action in collective organizations such as fishing cooperatives is thought to enhance the sustainability of fished populations. However, our knowledge of how collective action enables fishing cooperatives to achieve positive social-ecological outcomes is dispersed across case studies. Here, we present a quantitative, national-level analysis exploring the relationship between different levels of collective action and social-ecological outcomes. We found that strong collective action in Mexican lobster cooperatives was related to both sustaining their fisheries and benefiting from international trade. In the 15 year study period, lobster cooperatives that demonstrate characteristics associated with strong collective action captured benefits from trade through high catch volumes and revenue. Despite lower (but stable) average prices, the biomass of their lobster populations was not compromised to reap these benefits. Individual case studies previously found that fishing cooperatives can support both positive social and ecological outcomes in small-scale fisheries. Our results confirm these findings at a national level and highlight the importance of strong collective action. Thus, our work contributes to a better understanding of the governance arrangements to promote fishing communities’ welfare and benefits from international trade and, therefore, will be invaluable to advancing small-scale fisheries governance.","2022-10","2023-06-05 15:48:21","2023-12-07 17:41:37","2023-06-05 15:48:21","105003","","10","17","","Environ.

Bison are infected with brucellosis (Brucella abortus) and their seasonal movements can expose livestock to infection. Yellowstone National Park has embarked on a program of adaptive management of bison, which requires a model that assimilates data to support management decisions. We constructed a Bayesian state-space model to reveal the influence of brucellosis on the Yellowstone bison population. A frequency-dependent model of brucellosis transmission was superior to a density-dependent model in predicting out-of-sample observations of horizontal transmission probability. A mixture model including both transmission mechanisms converged on frequency dependence. Conditional on the frequency-dependent model, brucellosis median transmission rate was 1.87 yr−1. The median of the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive ratio (R0) was 1.75. Seroprevalence of adult females varied around 60% over two decades, but only 9.6 of 100 adult females were infectious. Brucellosis depressed recruitment; estimated population growth rate λ averaged 1.07 for an infected population and 1.11 for a healthy population. We used five-year forecasting to evaluate the ability of different actions to meet management goals relative to no action. Annually removing 200 seropositive female bison increased by 30-fold the probability of reducing seroprevalence below 40% and increased by a factor of 120 the probability of achieving a 50% reduction in transmission probability relative to no action. Annually vaccinating 200 seronegative animals increased the likelihood of a 50% reduction in transmission probability by fivefold over no action. However, including uncertainty in the ability to implement management by representing stochastic variation in the number of accessible bison dramatically reduced the probability of achieving goals using interventions relative to no action. Because the width of the posterior predictive distributions of future population states expands rapidly with increases in the forecast horizon, managers must accept high levels of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the necessity of iterative, adaptive management with relatively short-term commitment to action and frequent reevaluation in response to new data and model forecasts. We believe our approach has broad applications.","2015-11","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:41:37","","525–556","","4","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Ecological Society of America","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PLDFISX7/Hobbs et al. - 2015 - State-space modeling to support management of bruc.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; 2015; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Methods & Methodology; Fellow; T:Disease & Pests; K:adaptive management; K:uncertainty; K:disease transmission; K:USA; K:basic reproductive ratio; K:Bayesian state-space models; K:Bison bison; K:Brucella abortus; K:brucellosis; K:ecological forecasting; K:Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; K:host–parasite dynamics; K:serology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, managers lack an assessment method that integrates threat abatement and can be used when demographic data are limited. To help meet these needs, we demonstrated an approach for evaluating species status based on habitat configuration data. We applied 3 established persistence measures (patch occupancy, metapopulation capacity, and proportion of population lost) to compare 2 conservation strategies (critical habitat designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service's Carbonate Habitat Management Strategy) and 2 threat scenarios (maximum limestone mining, removal of all habitat in areas with mining claims; minimum mining, removal of habitat only in areas with existing operations and high-quality ore) against a baseline of existing habitat for 3 federally listed plant species. Protecting all area within the designated critical habitat maintained a similar level (83.9–99.9%) of species persistence as the baseline, whereas maximum mining greatly reduced persistence (0.51–38.4% maintained). The 3 persistence measures provided complementary insights reflecting different aspects of habitat availability (total area, number of patches, patch size, and connectivity). These measures can be used to link recovery criteria developed following the 3 R principles (representation, redundancy, and resilience) to the resulting improvements in species viability. By focusing on amount and distribution of habitat, our method provides a means of assessing the status of data-poor species to inform decision making under the Endangered Species Act.","2016-12","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:41:37","","1297–1306","","6","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BSH6FBVT/Che-Castaldo and Neel - 2016 - Species-level persistence probabilities for recove.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VJY32W5X/cobi.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 2; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Conservation; F:Actionable Research; T:Methods & Methodology; 2016; T:Risk; 2012PF-003; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:resilience; K:Endangered Species Act; K:recovery planning; K:3 Rs; K:extinction risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More often, water runs through, over, and under man-made sociopolitical divisions, making the governance of transboundary waters a formidable task. Although much of the public conversation regarding the availability and management of shared waters may appear to be dire (e.g., reports of “water wars”), there are transboundary basin water management strategies across the globe which offer hope. These include the efforts of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Stakeholders (ACFS) in the southeastern United States, which may serve as a useful template for future conversations around the water sharing table. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin (ACF Basin) is a vital economic engine in the southeastern United States. The waters of the ACF are shared between three states—Alabama, Florida, and Georgia—and harbor some of the richest freshwater biodiversity in North America, including sturgeon, rock bass, madtom, sculpin, bass, darters, and the highest densities of freshwater mussels in the world. Many of these are species of concern or threatened or endangered species; therefore, water management strategies in multiple portions of the ACF must comply with habitat protection plans under the U.S. Environmental Protection Act of 1970 (https://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/en/environmental-protection-act). The ACFS was organized in 2009 in the hopes of overcoming a decades-long stalemate between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, regarding the use of shared waters in the ACF Basin. Despite years of litigious relationships among these three states, the ACFS managed to bring a diverse and previously contentious set of water users to the table and build consensus on a shared water management plan for the entire ACF Basin. While the ACFS holds no regulatory power, they made more progress in breaking through existing distrust and deadlock than any previous efforts in this basin to date. In the end, they developed cooperation, respect, and a sustainable and adaptive water management plan which included input and buy-in from all identified water sectors in the ACF Basin. It is, therefore, a valuable exercise to examine the ACFS model and contemplate whether it contains exportable methodologies for other catchments challenged with managing transboundary waters.","2020-10","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:41:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Social Science; T:Natural Resource Management; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; F:Water & People; T:Governance & Decision Making; Fellow; K:water resource management; K:transboundary water agreements; K:Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin; K:consensus building; K:stakeholder-driven water management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In several countries, regulations have been put into place to improve the conditions of receiving water bodies, but planning and engineering of stormwater control is typically carried out at smaller scales. Quantifying cumulative effectiveness of many stormwater control measures on a watershed scale is critical to understanding how small-scale practices translate to urban river health. We review 100 empirical and modelling studies of stormwater management effectiveness at the watershed scale in diverse physiographic settings. Effects of networks with stormwater control measures (SCMs) that promote infiltration and harvest have been more intensively studied than have detention-based SCM networks. Studies of peak flows and flow volumes are common, whereas baseflow, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration have received comparatively little attention. Export of nutrients and suspended sediments have been the primary water quality focus in the United States, whereas metals, particularly those associated with sediments, have received greater attention in Europe and Australia. Often, quantifying cumulative effects of stormwater management is complicated by needing to separate its signal from the signal of urbanization itself, innate watershed characteristics that lead to a range of hydrologic and water quality responses, and the varying functions of multiple types of SCMs. Biases in geographic distribution of study areas, and size and impervious surface cover of watersheds studied also limit our understanding of responses. We propose hysteretic trajectories for how watershed function responds to increasing imperviousness and stormwater management. Even where impervious area is treated with SCMs, watershed function may not be restored to its predevelopment condition because of the lack of treatment of all stormwater generated from impervious surfaces; non-additive effects of individual SCMs; and persistence of urban effects beyond impervious surfaces. In most cases, pollutant load decreases largely result from run-off reductions rather than lowered solute or particulate concentrations. Understanding interactions between natural and built landscapes, including stormwater management strategies, is critical for successfully managing detrimental impacts of stormwater at the watershed scale.","2017-10","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:37","","4056-4080","","23","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","116 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9EFGAEGY/Jefferson et al. - 2017 - Stormwater management network effectiveness and im.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Water & People; T:Pollution; K:best management practices; K:stormwater management; GRA; K:green infrastructure; 2014PF-013; K:stormwater control measures; K:cumulative effects; K:low-impact development; K:urban catchments; K:urban hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, more than half of these forests have been lost since 1990 due to the rapid expansion of drainage-based agriculture and forestry. Within the oil palm sector, regional smallholder oil palm plantings on peat soils have risen quickly. These activities are challenging to govern and manage due to the numerous farmers and fragmented nature. It is imperative to understand the spatial distribution and drivers of smallholder oil palm-related conversion of peat swamp forests. In contrast to existing studies based on farm surveys, we used state-of-art maps of smallholder oil palm plantings derived from 2019 remote sensing data. Spatial data on socioeconomic and biophysical factors (e.g. mills, roads, water ways, and concessions) was then used to develop logistic regression models to investigate the relative influence of these factors. We show that spatial patterns of smallholder oil palm plantings are distinct from those of industrial oil palm plantations, revealing the critical roles of roads, especially service roads, residential roads and tracks, in driving smallholder oil palm expansion within peatlands. We found that 90% of smallholder oil palm areas were located within 2 km of roads and 25km of mills. The mean likelihood of a given land area being converted from peat swamp forests to smallholder oil palm declined rapidly with increasing distance from roads. In addition to roads, land use zones (e.g., the setting of concessions and migration settlements) and other environmental factors (e.g., precipitation and elevation) were identified as important drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion on peatland. Based on these findings, we identify priority regions for protection of remaining peat swamp forests in Indonesia and discuss strategies for tackling these sustainability challenges on local and global scales.","2022-01","2022-01-28 20:31:15","2023-12-07 17:41:36","2022-01-28 20:31:15","","","","","","Environ.

Adequate targeting of this support to priority areas is key to efficient and effective policy. We evaluated the targeting strategy of a national-level program in Mexico that distributed support based on seven criteria that prioritized poor smallholder farming communities at high risk of cropland failure. We used a series of logistic models to assess the coverage and leakage rates of the program’s targeting strategy and found rates of about 80 and 20 percent, respectively. We also found significant differences between the targeting priorities specified in program rules and the observed distribution of support measures. In general, the program favored arid and semi-arid regions at high risk of soil erosion but neglected smallholder farms in high-poverty regions with elevated rates of cropland failure. Our findings highlight the continued lack of financial support for smallholder agriculture in Mexico, despite program rules and priority statements that stress the vulnerability of this sector. This study also illustrates the important role of spatial targeting in better aligning agricultural support payments with stated policy priorities. This alignment is often overlooked in ex-post assessment, but it is critical for improving targeting precision, equity, and overall policy effectiveness.","2017-07","2021-08-10 20:27:38","2023-12-07 17:41:36","2021-08-10 20:27:38","740","","7","10","","","Spatial Targeting of Agricultural Support Measures","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KCMX6E7L/LaFevor et al. - 2021 - Spatial Targeting of Agricultural Support Measures.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RGZC3QGD/htm.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; Postdoc; T:Agriculture; F:Actionable Research; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Vulnerability; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2021; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:climate; K:poverty; 2014PF-014; K:agri-environmental policy; K:smallholder; K:targeted support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These effects are often correlated with temporal and spatial beta diversity patterns, with some local communities contributing more than others, a phenomenon known as local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) or ecological uniqueness. Microorganisms, such as diatoms, are considered whole-ecosystem indicators but little is known about their sensitivity and specificity in beta diversity studies, mostly because of the lack of large spatial and temporal datasets. To fill this gap, we used a tropical South American diatom database comprising modern (144 lakes) and paleolimnological (6 sediment cores) observations to quantify drivers of spatial and temporal beta diversity and evaluate implications for environmental change and regional biodiversity. We used methods of beta diversity partitioning (replacement and richness components) by determining contributions of local sites to these components (LCBDrepl and LCBDrich), and studied how they are related to environmental, geological, and historical variables using Generalized Additive Models. Beta replacement time series were also analyzed with GAM to test whether there is widespread biotic homogenization across the tropical Andes. Modern lake ecological uniqueness was jointly explained by limnological (pH), climatic (mean annual precipitation), and historical human impacts. Limnological (conductivity) and geodiversity variables (terrain ruggedness, soil variability) were inversely correlated to replacement and richness components of local contribution to beta diversity, suggesting that not all lakes contributing to regional diversity are targets for conservation actions. Over millennial time scales, decomposing temporal trends of beta diversity components showed different trajectories of lake diatom diversity as response of environmental change. This is shown by i) increased hydroclimatic variability (as inferred by decreased temperature seasonality) mediating higher contribution of richness to local beta diversity patterns ca. 1000 years ago in Ecuador Andean lakes; and ii) lake-specific temporal beta diversity trends for the last ca. 200 years, indicating that biotic homogenization is not widespread across the tropical Andes. Our approach for unifying diatom ecology, metacommunity studies, and paleolimnology can facilitate the understanding of future responses of tropical Andean lakes to global change impacts.","2020-09","2021-05-27 14:05:30","2023-12-07 17:41:36","2021-05-27 14:05:30","","","","8","","Front.

In particular, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has become the major component of haze with many adverse impacts and has therefore become of great concern to scientists, government, and the general public in China. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 in 269 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2016 and its associations with socioeconomic factors to identify the possible strategies for PM2.5 pollution mitigation. Specifically, we first quantified the spatial pattern of PM2.5 concentrations in both 2015 and 2016, and then changes between the two years. Next, we examined the relationship between socioeconomic factors and PM2.5 concentrations and changes. The results showed that most cities in eastern China experienced decreases in PM2.5 concentration, although most of these cities already had high PM2.5 pollution level. Cities with low PM2.5 concentrations experienced increases in PM2.5 concentrations and were mostly located in southern and southwestern China. The PM2.5 concentration was the highest in winter, followed by in spring, autumn and summer; for changes in PM2.5 concentrations, the highest magnitude of decrease occurred in summer, followed by the decreases in winter, autumn and spring. Cities with high PM2.5 concentrations tended to be clustered, but the clustered characteristics were not clearly related to the changes in PM2.5 concentrations. The relationship between PM2.5 concentration and urban size was an inverse U-shaped curve, suggesting the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for air quality in China. Population density and secondary industry share are the keys factors relating to air pollution control. In comparison to other cities, most moderately developed cities had a greater magnitude of decrease in PM2.5 concentrations and the key factor for pollution improvement was industrial structure; however, smaller cities tended to have a greater increase in PM2.5 concentrations and population density was the most important influencing factor. As a result, for air pollution control in China, specific regulations should be carried out according to different regions and different developmental stages based on the locations of cities.","2019-12","2020-11-17 20:34:34","2023-12-07 17:41:36","","","","Part A","133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","108 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZLLNLB4C/Zhao et al. - 2019 - Spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 concentrations and their relationship with socioeconomic factors in China's major.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/T7WZB64S/Zhao et al. - 2019 - Spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 concentrations a.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VVXGUYVE/S0160412019314837.html","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; T:Pollution; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2017PF-031; K:Spatial autocorrelation; K:Environmental Kuznets curve; K:PM concentrations; K:Socioeconomic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that seed treatment use has increased in major field crops over the last several decades but that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the extent of acreage planted with treated seeds, the amount of regional variability, and the use of certain active ingredients. One reason for this uncertainty is that farmers are less likely to know what pesticides are on their seed than they are about what pesticides are applied conventionally to their crops. This lack of information affects the quality and availability of seed treatment data and also farmers' ability to tailor pesticide use to production and environmental goals.","2020-05","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:41:36","","390–403","","5","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2020; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2017C16-006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nearly 10 years ago, I wrote an essay that began with various stories, including a utopian tale in which “science is an essential element in enabling a future in which larger populations are supported without permanent damage to the planet's living infrastructure. A balance is found between the need to use the world and the need to maintain functional ecosystems. [It would be] a future in which natural ecosystems are sustained while providing essential services to a human population that shows no signs of a decrease in growth.” I knew that for such a story to become a reality, changes in how researchers approach their work were required. As part of a visioning plan for the Ecological Society of America, I worked with a team to develop an action plan to enhance access to ecological knowledge; to stimulate more innovative, forward-looking research; and to build effective partnerships with natural resource managers (Palmer et al. 2005). Today, many of the authors of that plan call for even more changes, including new research frameworks, in order move toward a more sustainable world in which the health of ecosystems and human well-being are improved (Collins et al. 2011). Such frameworks are stimulating exciting new research, but I find myself thinking a great deal about the limits of that research in solving real-world problems.

Bed bug infestations are strongly associated with income, eviction rates and crowding at the neighbourhood level.

However, restricting urban outdoor water use to support watershed‐scale drought resilience may generate unanticipated cross‐scale interactions, for example, by altering drought response and recovery in urban vegetation or urban streamflow. Despite this, urban water conservation is rarely conceptualized or modeled as endogenous to the water cycle. Here, we investigate cross‐scale interactions among urban water conservation and water availability, water use, and sociohydrological response in Austin, TX (USA) during a recent anthropogenic (human‐influenced) drought. Multi‐scalar statistical analyses demonstrated that outdoor water conservation for reservoir management at the municipal scale produced responses that can cascade both ‘upwards' from the city to the watershed (e.g., decoupling streamflow patterns upstream and downstream of Austin at the watershed scale) and ‘downwards' to exert heterogeneous effects within the city (e.g., redistributing water along a socioeconomic gradient at sub‐municipal scales, with effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems). We suggest that adapting to anthropogenic drought through irrigation curtailment requires sustained engagement between hydrology and social sciences to integrate socioeconomic status and political feedbacks within and among irrigator groups into the water cycle. Findings from this cross‐disciplinary study highlight the importance of a multi‐scalar and spatially‐explicit perspectives in urban sociohydrology research to uncover how water conservation as adaptation to anthropogenic drought links hydrological processes with issues of socioeconomic inequality and spatiotemporal scale in the Anthropocene.","2018-03","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:41:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; Year 4; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:water conservation; K:sociohydrology; 2014T9-014; K:anthropogenic drought; K:cross-scale interactions; K:urban climate change adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Community gardens are social-ecological systems that support food production, social interactions, and biodiversity conservation. We investigate how these hubs of ecosystem services facilitate socio-ecological connectivity and service flows as a network across complex urban landscapes. In three US cities (Baltimore, Chicago, New York City), we use community garden networks as a model system to demonstrate how biophysical and social features of urban landscapes control the pattern and magnitude of ecosystem service flows through these systems. We show that community gardens within a city are connected through biological and social mechanisms, and connectivity levels and spatial arrangement differ across cities. We found that biophysical connectivity was higher than social connectivity in one case study, while they were nearly equal in the other two. This higher social connectivity can be attributed to clustered distributions of gardens within neighborhoods (network modularity), which promotes neighborhood-scale connectivity hotspots, but produces landscape-scale connectivity coldspots. The particular patterns illustrate how urban form and social amenities largely shape ecosystem service flows among garden networks. Such socio-ecological analyses can be applied to enhance and stabilize landscape connectedness to improve life and resilience in cities.","2020-12","2020-11-17 20:34:29","2023-12-07 17:41:34","","4252","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Research","","","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; C:Case Study; 2020; Year 6; 2017GS-002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The social and environmental implications of increased lithium demand is significant not only in the context of policy initiatives that are incentivizing electric vehicle adoption, but also because electric vehicle adoption is part of the vision of sustainability transitions that are being put forth in a variety of contexts. Any evidence that suggests that the externalities of the technology uptake are not being addressed would directly counter the intent of such initiatives. For LIBs to be fully sustainable, it is imperative that impacts along life cycle stages be adequately addressed, including lithium mineral extraction. This study investigates how the scope and focus of research in this area are changing and what drives their evolution. Based on a bibliometric analysis, we evaluate the state of research on the issues of lithium mineral extraction, use, and their impacts. The article identifies research hotspots and emerging research agendas by mapping the evolution of research focus and themes.

The capture and recycling of phosphorus (P), and other essential nutrients, from human excreta is particularly important as an alternative organic fertilizer source for agriculture. However, the complex set of socio-environmental factors influencing urban human excreta management is not yet sufficiently integrated into sustainable P research. Here, we synthesize information about the pathways P can take through urban sanitation systems along with barriers and facilitators to P recycling across cities. We examine five case study cities by using a sanitation chains approach: Accra, Ghana; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Beijing, China; Baltimore, USA; and London, England. Our cross-city comparison shows that London and Baltimore recycle a larger percentage of P from human excreta back to agricultural lands than other cities, and that there is a large diversity in socio-environmental factors that affect the patterns of recycling observed across cities. Our research highlights conditions that may be “necessary but not sufficient” for P recycling, including access to capital resources. Path dependencies of large sanitation infrastructure investments in the Global North contrast with rapidly urbanizing cities in the Global South, which present opportunities for alternative sanitation development pathways. Understanding such city-specific social and environmental barriers to P recycling options could help address multiple interacting societal objectives related to sanitation and provide options for satisfying global agricultural nutrient demand.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:34","","1–15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DBCNC3JX/Metson et al. - 2018 - Socio-environmental consideration of phosphorus fl.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A28DKBYQ/Metson et al. - 2018 - Socio-environmental consideration of phosphorus fl.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; C:Case Study; Workshop; K:sustainability; K:phosphorus; 2015W-052; K:urban; K:Sanitation; K:socio-environmental factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the Platte River Watershed in Nebraska (USA) as an exemplar mixed urban-agricultural watershed, we quantify biophysical response to drought in urban (Lincoln NE) and agricultural systems alongside a qualitative analysis of governance response and adaptive capacity of both sectors. Synthesis of results highlights parallels and discontinuities between urban and agricultural preparations for and response to drought. Whereas drought prompted an increase in well installations and expansion of water-intensive crops, e.g., corn, in the agricultural sector, outdoor water use restrictions rapidly curtailed water withdrawals in the urban sector, where water conservation has gradually decoupled total withdrawals from population growth. Water governance institutions at the municipal, district, and statewide levels showed evidence of learning and adaptive management, facilitated by a shared regional identity around agriculture. We conclude that, rather than exacerbating intersectoral conflict, cities may introduce a high-value and flexible water use that can be rapidly curtailed during drought. The ability to rapidly reduce urban water use and thereby avoid limiting agricultural irrigation during drought enables cities to provide adaptive capacity in mixed urban-agricultural watersheds, particularly where crops are highly reliant on irrigation.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:34","","art39","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; 2017; T:Agriculture; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Disturbance; K:drought; K:socio-environmental systems; K:irrigation; K:agricultural water management; 2014T9-014; K:urban water use; K:water policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such regimes, interpersonal relationships are expected to have a strong effect on a fisher's catch portfolio, the set of fish species targeted by an individual fisher. Here, we test three competing hypotheses about social influence using belief propagation network models and show that a peer-to-peer information-sharing social network is key to explaining catch portfolios at a small-scale fishery in Jamaica. We find that experience dictates the direction of influence among fishers in the social network, with older fishers and information brokers having distinct roles in shaping catch patterns for large- and small-sized fish species, respectively. These findings highlight concrete opportunities for harnessing social networks in natural resource management. Our new approach to modelling social influence is applicable to many social–ecological systems with minimal legal and institutional support or those that rely heavily on bottom-up participatory processes.","2019-10","2021-01-28 17:42:10","2023-12-07 17:41:33","2021-01-28 17:42:10","120-131","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/faf.12421","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EKJLMSSV/Alexander et al. - 2020 - Social ties explain catch portfolios of small-scal.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/T37SYUAP/Alexander et al. - 2020 - Social ties explain catch portfolios of small-scal.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ULRMFSTT/faf.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Sociology; Postdoc; 2019; T:Natural Resource Management; 2016PF-027; F:Water & People; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2016PF-023; K:social networks; Year 6 (SA); K:fisheries management; K:belief propagation network models; K:fisher behavior; K:fisher behaviour; K:social influence; Year 6 (PS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past decades, academic research has made substantial contributions to the understanding of fire and its interaction with climate and land management. Most reviews of the academic literature, however, are centered in either natural or social science. We offer an integrated cross-disciplinary guide to state-of-the art fire science and use this review to identify research gaps. We focus on the modern era and understanding fire in the context of a changing climate in western North America. We find that studies combining social and natural science perspectives remain limited and that interactions among coupled system components are poorly understood. For example, while natural science studies have identified how fuel treatments alter fire regimes, few social science studies examine how decisions are made about fuel treatments and how these decisions respond to changes in fire regimes. A key challenge is to better quantify the effects of actual fire management policies in a way that accounts for the complexity of coupled natural and natural–human system interactions.","2016-02","2020-11-17 20:35:25","2023-12-07 17:41:33","","67–86","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Z56I4TXQ/Ayres et al. - 2016 - Social ScienceNatural Science Perspectives on Wil.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CG8D2ZXX/gec3.html","","T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Climate Change; F:Land & Human Dynamics; 2016; 2014T10-007","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although multiple fields have independently addressed the concept of enabling conditions, the literature lacks a shared understanding or integration of concepts. We propose a more synthesized understanding of enabling conditions beyond disciplinary boundaries by focusing on the enabling conditions that influence the implementation of a range of environmental policies termed payments for ecosystem services (PES). Through an analysis of key literature from different disciplinary perspectives, we examined how researchers and practitioners refer to and identify enabling conditions within the context of PES. Through our synthesis, we identified 24 distinct enabling conditions organized within 4 broad themes: biophysical, economic, governance, and social-cultural conditions. We found that the literature coalesces around certain enabling conditions, such as strong ecosystem science and existing institutions, regardless of disciplinary background or journal audience. We also observed key differences in how authors perceive the direction of influence for property type, program objectives, and number of actors. Additionally, we noted an emphasis on the importance of the contextual nature of many enabling conditions that may cause certain conditions to have a disproportionate impact on successful implementation in some circumstances. Unraveling the relative importance of specific enabling conditions in diverse contexts remains a research frontier. Ultimately, no single disciplinary perspective is likely to provide all necessary insights for PES creation, and given the intertwined nature of enabling conditions, practitioners need to consider insights from multiple dimensions. Our work suggests opportunities to better connect diverse conversations through integration of concepts, a common vocabulary, and a synthetic framework.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:41:33","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 4; 2017; T:Economics; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Actionable Research; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:environmental governance; K:content analysis; 2014T9-003; K:payments for ecosystem services; K:enabling conditions; K:environmental synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two key components of this concept are: (1) social norms are an important driver of yard management; and (2) the influence of those norms varies spatially between front (public) to back (private). Thirty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted in six neighborhoods of Baltimore, MD, USA in the summer of 2016. We found that social pressures for yard care practices were not evenly expressed across front/back yards. Moreover, this front/back unevenness holds true in five out of the six neighborhoods we studied, indicating that the front/back, public/private distinction does not appear to be neighborhood-specific. This research extends prior work on the role of social pressures in yard care. Future research should consider this spatial scale of heterogeneity for social and environmental reasons.","2018-10","2020-11-17 20:34:58","2023-12-07 17:41:33","","1169–1188","","10","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Human Geography; T:Sociology; Postdoc; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; Year 7; Fellow; 2017PF-031; K:residential ecosystems; K:urban ecology; K:sustainability science; K:residential landscapes; K:Landscape Mullet concept; K:lawncare practices; K:yard care practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For seed system development, this has meant a focus on seed value chains predicated on standardized economic transactions and improved variety seeds. Building formal seed systems requires establishing and strengthening social institutions that reflect the market-oriented values of efficiency and standardization, institutions that often do not currently exist in many local and informal seed systems. This paper describes and analyzes efforts to develop formal seed systems in Sahelian West Africa over the past 10 years, and identifies the impacts for farmers of the social institutions that constitute formal seed systems. Using qualitative and spatial data and analysis, the paper characterizes farmers' and communities' experiences with seed access through the newly established formal seed system. The results demonstrate that the social and spatial extents of the formal and informal seed systems are extended and integrated through social institutions that reflect values inherent in both systems. The impacts of current market-oriented agricultural development projects are, therefore, more than in the past, in part because the social institutions associated with them are less singular in their vision for productive and economic efficiency.","2017-09","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:33","","998–1014","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Canadian Science Publishing 65 Auriga Drive, Suite 203, Ottawa, ON K2E 7W6","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Year 4; 2017; T:Sociology; T:Agriculture; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems","","Wenda K.

The vulnerability of coastal populations exposed to inundation will be greater for some sub-populations due to differences in their socio-demographic characteristics. Many climate risk and vulnerability assessments, however, model current populations against future environments. We advance sea-level rise risk assessments by dynamically modeling environmental change and socio-demographic change. We project three scenarios of inundation exposure due to future sea-level rise in coastal Georgia from 2010 to 2050. We align the sea-level rise projections with five population projection scenarios of socially vulnerable sub-populations via the Hamilton-Perry method and the theory of demographic metabolism. Our combined fast sea-level rise and middle population scenarios project a near doubling of the population exposed, and a more than five-fold increase for those at risk (i.e., residing in a census tract with high social vulnerability) and most at risk (i.e., high social vulnerability and high exposure) compared to the same estimate based on 2010 population data. Of vulnerable sub-populations, women had the largest absolute increase in exposure for all scenario combinations. The Hispanic/Latinx population's exposure increased the largest proportionally under the fast and medium sea-level rise projections and elderly people's (65+) under the slow sea-level rise scenario. Our findings suggest that for coastal areas experiencing rapid growth (or declines) in more socially vulnerable sub-populations, estimates based on current population data are likely to underestimate (or overestimate) the proportion of such groups' risk to inundation from future sea-level rise.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:33","","10–20","","","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QPDWDBAF/Hardy and Hauer - 2018 - Social vulnerability projections improve sea-level.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RGSLLMBN/S0143622817309189.html","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Human Geography; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Vulnerability; K:Risk assessment; 2016PF-028; K:sea level rise; T:Coasts & Shorelines; Sea-level rise; K:Demographic metabolism; K:Georgia; K:Social vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are a highly social, ubiquitous, and invasive freshwater fish. Management strategies targeting foraging carp may be ideal because laboratory studies have suggested that carp can learn, have individual personalities, a unique diet, and often form large social groups. To examine social feeding behaviors of wild carp, we injected 344 carp with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and continuously monitored their feeding behaviors at multiple sites in a natural lake in Minnesota, USA. The high-resolution, spatio-temporal data were analyzed using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Based on these associations, we analyzed group size, feeding bout duration, and the heterogeneity and connectivity of carp social networks at foraging sites. Wild carp responded quickly to bait, forming aggregations most active from dusk to dawn. During the 2020 baiting period (20 days), 133 unique carp were detected 616,593 times. There was some evidence that feeding at multiple sites was constrained by basin geography, but not distance alone. GMM results suggested that feeding bouts were short, with frequent turnover of small groups. Individual foraging behavior was highly heterogeneous with Gini coefficients of 0.79 in 2020 and 0.66 in 2019. “Superfeeders”—those contributing to 80% of total cumulative detections (top 18% and top 29% of foragers in 2020 and 2019 respectively)—were more likely to be detected earlier at feeding stations, had larger body sizes, and had higher network measures of degree, weighted degree, and betweenness than non-superfeeders. Overall, our results indicate that wild carp foraging is social, easily induced by bait, dominated by large-bodied individuals, and potentially predictable, which suggests social behaviors could be leveraged in management of carp, one of the world's most recognizable and invasive fish.","2022-01","2022-03-11 13:28:22","2023-12-07 17:41:32","2022-03-11 13:28:22","e8666","","3","12","","","Social associations in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.8666","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/H737ZD25/Hundt et al. - 2022 - Social associations in common carp (Cyprinus carpi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2TDDS2AN/ece3.html","","no acknowledgment; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; 2022; Year X; 2018PF-040; K:Fish; K:contact networks; K:social network analysis; k:animal social networks; K:baiting; K:feeding bouts; K:invasive species management; K:social aggregations; K:spatio-temporal data streams","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If only a fraction of the time spent playing computer games could be harnessed for research, it would open up a huge range of new opportunities. We review the use of games in research, education, and entertainment and develop ideas for integrating these three functions around the idea of ecosystem services valuation. This approach to valuation can be seen as a version of choice modeling that allows players to generate their own scenarios taking account of the trade-offs embedded in the game, rather than simply ranking pre-formed scenarios.

Smallholders are expected to respond to rising temperatures and precipitation anomalies through on-farm management strategies and diversification into off-farm activities. However, few studies have empirically examined the relationship between climate anomalies and rural livelihoods. Our research explores the impact of climate anomalies on farmers' on and off-farm livelihood strategies, considering both annual and decadal climate exposures, the relationship between on and off-farm livelihoods, and the implications of these livelihood strategies for agricultural productivity. To examine these issues, we link gridded climate data to survey data collected in 120 communities from 850 Ugandan households and 2000 agricultural plots in 2003 and 2013. We find that smallholder livelihoods are responsive to climate exposure over both short and long time scales. Droughts decrease agricultural productivity in the short term and reduce individual livelihood diversification in the long term. Smallholders cope with higher temperatures in the short term, but in the long run, farmers struggle to adapt to above-average temperatures, which lower agricultural productivity and reduce opportunities for diversification. On and off-farm livelihood strategies also appear to operate in parallel, rather than by substituting for one another. These observations suggest that new strategies will be necessary if rural smallholders are to successfully adapt to climate change.","2018-11","2020-11-17 20:30:19","2023-12-07 17:41:32","","132–144","","","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","44 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/AQL5YBU8/Call et al. - 2019 - Smallholder responses to climate anomalies in rura.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RYBG86UH/Call, Gray, Jagger - 2018 - Smallholder responses to climate anomalies in rural Uganda.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/L5I8R6WJ/S0305750X18304133.html","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Economics; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; Year 7; F:Food Systems & the Environment; wrong DBI; 2017PF-033; K:Sub-Saharan Africa; K:Rural livelihoods; K:Uganda","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different approaches have been suggested for coping with species on the move in conservation. Here, we test the effectiveness of different MPA designs, including dynamic, network, and different directional orientations on protecting shifting species under climate change through ecosystem modeling in a theoretical ecosystem. Our findings suggest that dynamic MPAs may benefit some species (e.g., whiting and anchovy) and fishing fleets, and these benefits can inform the design or adaptation of MPAs worldwide. In addition, we find that it is important to design MPAs with specific goals and to account for the effects of released fishing pressure and species interactions in MPA design.","2020-11","2020-11-20 19:02:52","2023-12-07 17:41:31","2020-11-20 19:02:52","e0241771","","11","15","","PLOS ONE","Shifting seas, shifting boundaries","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","19 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PWDC87X7/Cashion et al. - 2020 - Shifting seas, shifting boundaries Dynamic marine.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NZ77JP4Y/article.html","","Grad Pursuit; sesync acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; T:Sustainability; reported to NSF; T:Conservation; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; 2020; F:Actionable Research; F:Water & People; T:Fisheries; K:ecosystems; 2018GS5-005; K:marine fish; K:ecosystem functioning; K:biomass; K:ecosystem modeling; K:predator-prey dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although economic valuations of biological pest control in agriculture show an impressive cost savings from this ecosystem service, no direct estimate of the value of biodiversity for biological control has been attempted. We apply a basic microeconomic model for estimating the value of changes in the richness of arthropod natural enemies or in functional diversity for biological pest control for two sample crops using experimental results reported in the ecological literature. Market-based outcomes were driven by changes in crop yields associated with experimental reductions in natural enemy species richness, and modified by supply shifts and price elasticities. We show how our simple model differs from common approaches used in the ecological literature, and explain why this alternative model more accurately estimates societal well-being for consumers and producers participating in these crop markets. We conclude by discussing the additional research and data needed to make economic valuation of ecosystem services in agricultural settings more feasible, rigorous, and realistic in the future.","2015-12","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:41:31","","215–225","","","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TB6X4MAE/Letourneau et al. - 2015 - Simple-but-sound methods for estimating the value .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WQAMESTP/S0921800915004231.html","","no acknowledgment; T:Economics; Year 1; 2015; T:Agriculture; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Venture; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Ecosystem services; 2012V-006; K:Economic valuation; K:Functional diversity; K:Natural enemy; K:Species richness; K:Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One pressing challenge in the era of “Big Data” and given the flexibility of representation afforded by ABMs, is identifying the appropriate level of complicatedness in model structure for representing and investigating complex real-world systems. In this paper, we differentiate the concepts of complexity (model behaviour) and complicatedness (model structure), and illustrate the non-linear relationship between them. We then systematically evaluate the trade-offs between simple (often theoretical) models and complicated (often empirically-grounded) models. We propose using pattern-oriented modelling, stepwise approaches, and modular design to guide modellers in reaching an appropriate level of model complicatedness. While ABMs should be constructed as simple as possible but as complicated as necessary to address the predefined research questions, we also warn modellers of the pitfalls and risks of building “mid-level” models mixing stylized and empirical components.","2016-12","2020-11-17 20:35:16","2023-12-07 17:41:31","","56–67","","","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","105 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3RZX45YY/Sun et al. - 2016 - Simple or complicated agent-based models A compli.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9MHF3C8M/S1364815216306041.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; K:agent-based modeling; T:Modeling; 2016; K:Agent-based models; K:complexity; K:Empirically grounded models; K:Model complicatedness; K:Pattern-oriented modeling; K:Stepwise approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seafood is the most traded food commodity and is globally important to human nutrition. The seafood production and trade system is exposed to a variety of disruptions including fishery collapses, natural disasters, oil spills, policy changes, and aquaculture disease outbreaks, aquafeed resource access and price spikes. The patterns and trends of these shocks to fisheries and aquaculture are poorly characterized and this limits the ability to generalize or predict responses to political, economic, and environmental changes. We applied a statistical shock detection approach to historic fisheries and aquaculture data to identify shocks over the period 1976–2011. A complementary case study approach was used to identify possible key social and political dynamics related to these shocks. The lack of a trend in the frequency or magnitude of the identified shocks and the range of identified causes suggest shocks are a common feature of these systems which occur due to a variety, and often multiple and simultaneous, causes. Shocks occurred most frequently in the Caribbean and Central America, the Middle East and North Africa, and South America, while the largest magnitude shocks occurred in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Shocks also occurred more frequently in aquaculture systems than in capture systems, particularly in recent years. In response to shocks, countries tend to increase imports and experience decreases in supply. The specific combination of changes in trade and supply are context specific, which is highlighted through four case studies. Historical examples of shocks considered in this study can inform policy for responding to shocks and identify potential risks and opportunities to build resilience in the global food system.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:41:31","","24–32","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","68 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/T5BVMYKU/Gephart et al. - 2017 - Shocks to fish production Identification, trends,.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DYS9ZGH9/S0959378016304897.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; 2017; Postdoc; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Fisheries; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; T:Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An integrative understanding of these controls is needed to inform fire predictions and hydrologic management to reduce fire vulnerability. The Great Dismal Swamp, a drained peatland (Virginia and North Carolina, USA), recently experienced large wildfires, motivating hydrologic restoration efforts. To inform those efforts, we combined continuous water levels, soil properties, moisture-holding capacity, and smouldering probability at four sites along a hydrologic gradient. For each site, we estimated gravimetric soil moisture content associated with a 50% smouldering probability (soil moisture smoulder threshold) and the water tension required to create this moisture threshold (tension smoulder threshold). Soil properties influenced both thresholds. Soils with lower bulk density smouldered at higher moisture content but also had higher moisture-holding capacity, indicating that higher tensions (e.g., deeper water tables) are required to reach smouldering thresholds. By combining thresholds with water-level data, we assessed smouldering vulnerability over time, providing a framework to guide fire prediction and hydrologic restoration. This work is among the first to integrate soil moisture thresholds, moisture-holding capacities and water-level dynamics to explore spatiotemporal variation in smouldering fire vulnerability.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:34:44","2023-12-07 17:41:31","","177-186","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/E72U3H2F/Schulte et al. - 2019 - Short- and long-term hydrologic controls on smould.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/X253EKDK/WF18086.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; Postdoc; 2019; Year 7; K:soil properties; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; K:soils; 2017PF-034; K:Great Dismal Swamp; K:ignition thresholds; K:moisture holding capacity; K:organic soil; K:swampland; K:swamps","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ongoing push for wetland restoration presents an opportunity for climate mitigation, but C storage expectations are poorly defined due to a lack of reference information and an incomplete understanding of what drives natural variability among wetlands. We sought to address these shortcomings by (1) quantifying the range of variability in wetland soil organic C (SOC) stocks on a depressional landscape (Delmarva Peninsula, USA) and (2) investigating the role of hydrology and relative topography in explaining variability among wetlands. We found a high degree of variability within individual wetlands and among wetlands with similar vegetation and hydrogeomorphic characteristics. This suggests that uncertainty should be presented explicitly when inferring ecosystem processes from wetland types or land cover classes. Differences in hydrologic regimes, particularly the rate of water level recession, explained some of the variability among wetlands, but relationships between SOC stocks and some hydrologic metrics were eclipsed by factors associated with separate study sites. Relative topography accounted for a similar portion of SOC stock variability as hydrology, indicating that it could be an effective substitute in large-scale analyses. As wetlands worldwide are restored and focus increases on quantifying C benefits, the importance of appropriately defining and assessing reference systems is paramount. Our results highlight the current uncertainty in this process, but suggest that incorporating landscape heterogeneity and drivers of natural variability into reference information may improve how wetland restoration is implemented and evaluated.","2023-05","2023-05-31 20:46:27","2023-12-07 17:41:30","2023-05-31 20:46:27","064014","","6","18","","Environ.

In this Review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding knowledge of human mobility and migration responses to SLR, providing a coherent roadmap for future SLR research and associated policy. While it is often assumed that direct inundation forces a migration, we discuss how mobility responses are instead driven by a diversity of socioeconomic and demographic factors, which, in some cases, do not result in a migration response. We link SLR hazards with potential mechanisms of migration and the associated governmental or institutional policies that operate as obstacles or facilitators for that migration. Specific examples from the USA, Bangladesh and atoll island nations are used to contextualize these concepts. However, further research is needed on the fundamental mechanisms underlying SLR migration, tipping points, thresholds and feedbacks, risk perception and migration to fully understand migration responses to SLR.","2019-12","2021-05-28 20:49:38","2023-12-07 17:41:30","2021-05-28 20:49:38","28-39","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu","","156 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HCLCBF77/s43017-019-0002-9.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HCUU6CTZ/s43017-019-0002-9.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; T:Climate Change; Postdoc; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2017C16-010; 2017PF-033; Year 7 (MC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climatic conditions are known to be key drivers of water budgets at both individual GIW and landscape scales; however differences in hydrologic response across these scales may provide insights into how GIWs influence downstream waters. In this study, we use a combination of GIW water level, gaged streamflow, and climatic data to explore linkages between seasonal climatic drivers, GIW hydrology, and downstream discharges within the Coastal Plain of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. We first examine water balance components at the larger watershed scale, where climatic drivers result in an energy-limited wet season from December to May and a water-limited dry season from June to November. We compare long-term water levels of three GIWs with downstream discharges. GIW water level and downstream discharges are correlated at seasonal (R2: 0.52–0.60) and daily (R2: 0.52–0.76) time steps. However, during dry seasons, GIW water level receded at a faster rate than downstream discharges, highlighting the influence of evapotranspiration on surface and shallow subsurface water storage. Conversely during wet seasons, GIW water level receded slower than downstream discharges, highlighting a potential period for surface water connectivity between GIWs and downstream discharges. Cumulatively, these findings quantify the impact of seasonal climatic drivers on GIW hydrology and connectivity to downstream waters.","2020-04","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:41:30","","","","","583","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QILU94A6/Lee et al. - 2020 - Seasonal drivers of geographically isolated wetlan.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2020; Year 7; F:Water & People; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017PF-034; K:Hydrologic connectivity; K:Climatic drivers; K:Geographically isolated wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

River rhythmicity can serve as a lens into the temporal dimension of river formation and socio-ecological dynamics that are of great interest to many disciplines. In this paper, we introduce river rhythmicity as a conceptual and analytical framework to unify riparian human communities, academic disciplines and water agencies in approaching research and management of rivers. We also explore how the disruptions to riverine rhythms that are experienced by river-dwelling communities, and are often visible in river discharge data through time, reconfigure, hinder or sever relationships between people and rivers. To ground our discussion in practical, lived experience, we provide brief descriptions of regimes of river time to demonstrate how rhythmic patterns established with rivers in north-central Canada and Amazonian Colombia shape the lives of two of our co-authors. By prioritizing holistic accounts of river rhythms, we can elucidate a fuller range of phenomena and their dynamic interactions, revealing riverscape features that are highly valued by local communities yet not often visible to any one discipline. Rhythmicity provides a conceptual framework to help address several challenges facing river conservation and water allocation dilemmas. By emphasizing relationality, it serves to (a) move beyond a biophysical framing of human-nature connectedness by demonstrating that dynamic processes and relationships are constitutive of rivers, not derivative of them; (b) enhance understanding of how the temporal dimensions of riverine relationships and river dwelling are experienced; (c) highlight the socio-cultural consequences of changes to river time and (d) centre socially embedded relationships with rivers forged from generations of observations of care and reciprocity.

The schistosomiasis pathology results mainly from inflammatory processes caused by parasites’ eggs in the human body, which may lead to several conditions such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic anemia, cognitive impairment in children, growth stunting, infertility, a higher risk of contracting HIV in women, and death from liver failure or bladder cancer in cases of intense and chronic infection. These effects, combined with poverty and a lack of access to clean water, improved sanitation and hygiene make schistosomiasis one of the world’s most important, but also most neglected, human diseases. The intermediate host snails of schistosome parasites are poikilotherm—that is, their body temperature changes depending on the environment. As a result, reproduction, survival, and dispersal are strongly influenced by ambient temperature, as is parasite development inside the snail. Therefore, rising water temperatures and altered precipitation associated with climate change could considerably alter the distribution and abundance of the intermediate host snail and its schistosome parasites, resulting in a shift in disease dynamics and transmission to people. Assessing the impact of global warming and its compounded effect with change in land use are important challenges that will face global health soon. Predicting the effect of global climate change on schistosomiasis is a complex task,23 because how the disease responds to climate varies with the specific ecology of many different snails and parasite species (table 1) as well as the geographic context that may respond differently to rising temperatures and changes in precipitation (fig 1). We discuss potential effects of climate change on schistosomiasis, its interactions with other determinants of disease transmission, and considerations for schistosomiasis control and elimination in a changing world.","2020-11","2020-11-25 14:22:43","2023-12-07 17:41:29","2020-11-25 14:22:30","","","","371","","BMJ","","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Aquaculture encompasses a range of species and cultivation methods, resulting in diverse social, economic, nutritional, and environmental outcomes. As a result, how aquaculture develops will influence human wellbeing and environmental health outcomes. Recognition of this has spurred a push for nutrition-sensitive aquaculture, which aims to benefit public health through the production of diverse, nutrient-rich seafood and enabling equitable access. This article explores plausible aquaculture futures and their role in nutrition security using a qualitative scenario approach. Two dimensions of economic development – the degree of globalization and the predominant economic development philosophy – bound four scenarios representing systems that are either localized or globalized, and orientated toward maximizing sectoral economic growth or to meeting environmental and equity dimensions of sustainability. The potential contribution of aquaculture in improving nutrition security is then evaluated within each scenario. While aquaculture could be “nutrition-sensitive” under any of the scenarios, its contribution to addressing health inequities is more likely in the economic and political context of a more globally harmonized trade environment and where economic policies are oriented toward social equity and environmental sustainability.","2020-07","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:41:29","","122-138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","76 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Taylor & Francis","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FXKMGLCG/Gephart et al. - 2021 - Scenarios for Global Aquaculture and Its Role in H.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XZ7KGUCC/23308249.2020.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; Postdoc; Year 5; 2020; F:Water & People; T:Fisheries; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; Year 6 (JG); 2015C12-041; K:food security; K:food sovereignty; K:globalization; K:Aquatic foods; K:nutrition security; K:nutrition-sensitive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over 100 years of agricultural development the Murrumbidgee Basin experienced a “pendulum swing” in terms of water allocation, initially exclusively for agriculture production changing over to reallocation back to the environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that in the competition for water between economic livelihood and environmental wellbeing, economic diversification was the key to swinging community sentiment in favor of environmental protection, and triggering policy action that resulted in more water allocation to the environment. To test this hypothesis, we developed a sociohydrology model to link the dynamics of the whole economy (both agriculture and industry composed of manufacturing and services) to the community's sensitivity toward the environment. Changing community sensitivity influenced how water was allocated and governed and how the agricultural sector grew relative to the industrial sector (composed of manufacturing and services sectors). In this way, we show that economic diversification played a key role in influencing the community's values and preferences with respect to the environment and economic growth. Without diversification, model simulations show that the community would not have been sufficiently sensitive and willing enough to act to restore the environment, highlighting the key role of sectoral transformation in achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development.","2017-09","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V6N5CNQI/Roobavannan et al. - 2017 - Role of Sectoral Transformation in the Evolution o.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/AYLPG2MF/2017WR020671.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; Pursuit; T:Economics; Year 2; T:Agriculture; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; 2013T5-001; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Water & People; K:modeling; K:water management; K:sociohydrology; K:changing values; K:sectoral transformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While responses might moderate a specific hazard, due to the complexity of climate change risk they may be ineffective at reducing net climate-related risk for any given actor or system.

However, risks to biodiversity from temperature overshoot pathways are poorly described. Here, we explore biodiversity risks from overshoot by synthesizing existing knowledge and quantifying the dynamics of exposure and de-exposure to potentially dangerous temperatures for more than 30 000 species for a 2°C overshoot scenario. Our results suggest that climate risk to biodiversity from temperature overshoot pathways will arrive suddenly, but decrease only gradually. Peak exposure for biodiversity occurs around the same time as peak global warming, but the rate of de-exposure lags behind the temperature decline. While the global overshoot period lasts around 60 years, the duration of elevated exposure of marine and terrestrial biodiversity is substantially longer (around 100 and 130 years, respectively), with some ecological communities never returning to pre-overshoot exposure levels. Key biodiversity impacts may be irreversible and reliance on widespread CO2 removal to reduce warming poses additional risks to biodiversity through altered land use. Avoiding any temperature overshoot must be a priority for reducing biodiversity risks from climate change, followed by limiting the magnitude and duration of any overshoot. More integrated models that include direct and indirect impacts from overshoot are needed to inform policy.

Because human land-based activities can alter natural processes in ways that affect adjacent aquatic ecosystems, land-sea interactions are increasingly recognized as critical to coastal conservation planning and governance. However, the complex socioeconomic dynamics inherent in coastal and marine socio-ecological systems (SES) have received little consideration. Drawing on knowledge generalized from long-term studies in Caribbean Nicaragua, we propose a conceptual framework that clarifies the multiple ways that socioeconomically driven behavior can link the land and sea. In addition to other ecosystem effects, we illustrate how feedbacks resulting from changes to aquatic resources can influence terrestrial resource management decisions and land uses. An assessment of this framework using empirical studies from a variety of coastal SES suggests its broad applicability, but also highlights the paucity of research that explicitly investigates the effects of human behavior on coastal SES dynamics. Therefore, we encourage both researchers and policymakers to consider direct, indirect, and bidirectional cross-ecosystem links that move beyond traditionally recognized land to sea processes.","2021-06","2021-06-25 18:38:27","2023-12-07 17:41:27","2021-06-25 18:38:26","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","This article is protected by copyright.

Because climate change is likely to impose novel ecosystem stressors, a typical approach to valuing benefits may fail to capture the contribution of ecosystem resilience to sustaining long‐term benefits. Unfortunately, we generally lack predictive probabilistic models that would enable measurement and valuation of resilience. Therefore, alternative measures are needed to complement monetary values and broaden understanding of restoration benefits. We use a case study of Chesapeake Bay restoration (total maximum daily load) to show that ecosystem service benefits that are typically monetized leave critical information gaps. To address these gaps, we review evidence for ecosystem services that can be quantified or described, including changes in harmful algal bloom risks. We further propose two integrative indicators of estuarine resilience—the extent of submerged aquatic vegetation and spatial distribution of fish. Submerged aquatic vegetation extent is indicative of qualities of ecosystems that promote positive feedbacks to water quality. Broadly distributed fish populations reduce risk by promoting diverse responses to spatially heterogeneous stresses. Our synthesis and new analyses for the Chesapeake Bay suggest that resilience metrics improve understanding of restoration benefits by demonstrating how nutrient and sediment load reductions will alleviate multiple sources of stress, thereby enhancing the system's capacity to absorb or adapt to extreme events or novel stresses.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:27","","","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EBSK3KRY/Wainger et al. - 2017 - Resilience indicators support valuation of estuari.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/84YVJKYA/ehs2.html","","T:Resilience; 2017; no acknowledgment; T:Economics; Postdoc; C:Case Study; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:ecosystem services; K:climate change; K:water quality; 2016PF-024; K:benefit‐relevant indicators; K:economic valuation; K:non‐monetary benefit indicators; K:total maximum daily load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the factors that contribute to the global food system's ability to respond and adapt to such disruptions (i.e. resilience) is critical for understanding the long-term sustainability of human populations. Variable impacts of production shocks on food supply between countries indicate a need for national-scale resilience indicators that can provide global comparisons. However, methods for tracking changes in resilience have had limited application to food systems. We developed an indicator-based analysis of food systems resilience for the years 1992-2011. Our approach is based on three dimensions of resilience: socio-economic access to food in terms of income of the poorest quintile relative to food prices, biophysical capacity to intensify or extensify food production, and the magnitude and diversity of current domestic food production. The socio-economic indicator has large variability, but with low values concentrated in Africa and Asia. The biophysical capacity indicator is highest in Africa and Eastern Europe, in part because of high potential for extensification of cropland and for yield gap closure in cultivated areas. However, the biophysical capacity indicator has declined globally in recent years. The production diversity indicator has increased slightly, with a relatively even geographic distribution. Few countries had exclusively high or low values for all indicators. Collectively, these results are the basis for global comparisons of resilience between nations, and provide necessary context for developing generalizations about the resilience in the global food system.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:41:27","","","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","92 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3RAZA6RV/Seekell et al. - 2017 - Resilience in the global food system.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; T:Resilience; 2017; T:Economics; Postdoc; Venture; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Year 3; Fellow; 2014PF-012; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2014V-029; 2016PF-029; Year 4 (JD); Year 6 (JG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulatory requirements for assessing project outcome were minimal; visual assessments were the most common and 97% of the projects reported suboptimal or marginal habitat even after 5 years of monitoring. Less than a third of the projects provided biotic or chemical data; most of these were impaired with biotic indices below state standards and stream conductivity exceeding federal water quality criteria. Levels of selenium known to impair aquatic life were reported in 7 of the 11 projects that provided Se data.

Nonetheless, few studies have documented the recovery of ecosystems globally or the rates at which ecosystems recover. Even fewer have addressed the added benefit of actively restoring ecosystems versus allowing them to recover without human intervention following the cessation of a disturbance. Our meta-analysis of 400 studies worldwide that document recovery from large-scale disturbances, such as oil spills, agriculture and logging, suggests that though ecosystems are progressing towards recovery following disturbances, they rarely recover completely. This result reinforces conservation of intact ecosystems as a key strategy for protecting biodiversity. Recovery rates slowed down with time since the disturbance ended, suggesting that the final stages of recovery are the most challenging to achieve. Active restoration did not result in faster or more complete recovery than simply ending the disturbances ecosystems face. Our results on the added benefit of restoration must be interpreted cautiously, because few studies directly compared different restoration actions in the same location after the same disturbance. The lack of consistent value added of active restoration following disturbance suggests that passive recovery should be considered as a first option; if recovery is slow, then active restoration actions should be better tailored to overcome specific obstacles to recovery and achieve restoration goals. We call for a more strategic investment of limited restoration resources into innovative collaborative efforts between scientists, local communities and practitioners to develop restoration techniques that are ecologically, economically and socially viable.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:41:27","","20172577","","1873","285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","184 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Royal Society PMID: 29491171","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QSBGTYYE/Jones et al. - 2018 - Restoration and repair of Earth's damaged ecosyste.pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Resilience; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Conservation; Year 3; T:Disturbance; 2013T7-015; K:restoration; K:recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Areas where streams were likely buried into the sewer system were mapped by intersecting the historical stream network derived from a 10-m resolution digital elevation model with sewer pipe locations. Potential sewer leakage hotspots were mapped by identifying where aging sewer pipes are in close proximity (50-m) to surface waterways. Results from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA), indicated 41% of the historical stream length was lost or buried and the potential interface between sewers and streams is great. The co-location of aging sewer infrastructure (>75 years old) near stream channels suggests that 42% of existing streams are located in areas with a high potential for sewer leakage if sewer infrastructure fails. Mapping the sewer-stream interface provides an approach to better understand areas where failing sewers may contribute a disproportional amount of nutrients and other pathogens to surface waterways.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:12","2023-12-07 17:41:26","","320-324","","","170","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/UYHXME5W/Hopkins and Bain - 2018 - Research Note Mapping spatial patterns in sewer a.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RX7HNT4V/S0169204617300920.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Pollution; 2014PF-013; K:Sanitation; K:Hotspot mapping; K:Sewer leakage; K:Stream burial; K:Urban stream","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces a model that simulates the short-term response to a food supply shock originating in a single country, which is partly absorbed through decreases in domestic reserves and consumption, and partly transmitted through the adjustment of trade flows. By applying the model to publicly-available data for the cereals commodity group over a 17 year period, we find that differential outcomes of supply shocks simulated through this time period are driven not only by the intensification of trade, but as importantly by changes in the distribution of reserves. Our analysis also identifies countries where trade dependency may accentuate the risk of food shortages from foreign production shocks; such risk could be reduced by increasing domestic reserves or importing food from a diversity of suppliers that possess their own reserves. This simulation-based model provides a framework to study the short-term, nonlinear and out-of-equilibrium response of trade networks to supply shocks, and could be applied to specific scenarios of environmental or economic perturbations.","2016-09","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:41:26","","","","11","127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","82 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Venture; 2016; T:Vulnerability; Year 3; Fellow; 2014PF-012; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2014V-029; 2016PF-029; Year 4 (JD); Year 6 (JG); T:Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that lawns are widespread across diverse climatic regions and there is rising concern about the environmental impacts associated with their management, there is a clear need to understand the geographic variation, drivers, and outcomes of common yard care practices. We hypothesized that 1) income, age, and the number of neighbors known by name will be positively associated with the odds of having irrigated, fertilized, or applied pesticides in the last year, 2) irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application will vary quadratically with population density, with the highest odds in suburban areas, and 3) the odds of irrigating will vary by climate, but fertilization and pesticide application will not. We used multi-level models to systematically address nested spatial scales within and across six U.S. metropolitan areas—Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. We found significant variation in yard care practices at the household (the relationship with income was positive), urban-exurban gradient (the relationship with population density was an inverted U), and regional scales (city-to-city variation). A multi-level modeling framework was useful for discerning these scale-dependent outcomes because this approach controls for autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales. Our findings may guide policies or programs seeking to mitigate the potentially deleterious outcomes associated with water use and chemical application, by identifying the subpopulations most likely to irrigate, fertilize, and/or apply pesticides.","2019-11","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:41:26","","","","11","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/TK9H8B96/Locke et al. - 2019 - Residential household yard care practices along urban-exurban gradients in six climatically-diverse U.S. metropoli.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; T:Human Geography; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; Year 7; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2017PF-031; K:urban areas; K:pesticides; K:neighborhoods; K:fertilization; K:population density; K:agricultural irrigation; K:fertilizers; K:Mathematical models","","Christopher A.

We summarize resilience assessments conducted in each system to provide a synthesis and reference by the other articles in this special feature. We also present a general framework used to evaluate the interactions between society and ecosystem regimes and the governance regimes chosen to mediate those interactions. The case studies show different ways that adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by ecological and/or legal processes. The resilience assessments indicate that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and recovery, which includes lurches in adaptation and learning, and (3) periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross scale (Panarchy) interactions among levels and sectors of government and society illustrate that they may constrain development trajectories, but may also provide stability during crisis or innovation at smaller scales; create crises, but may also facilitate recovery; and constrain system transformation, but may also provide windows of opportunity in which transformation, and the resources to accomplish it, may occur.

As a result, declines in wild-caught fish landings threaten nutritionally vulnerable populations. Aquaculture presents an opportunity to meet local demand, but it also places pressure on natural resource inputs and causes a range of environmental impacts. Here, we examine whether current aquaculture systems in Bangladesh can be reoriented to address prevailing nutritional deficiencies while minimizing these environmental impacts. Current fish farming practices, even when optimized, cannot fully supply the same essential micronutrient densities of zinc, iron and calcium as wild-caught fish. However, when the proportion of highly nutrient-dense small indigenous fish species (SIS) was increased to at least 30% of the total output in any of the 14 aquaculture production systems analysed, these systems were able to meet or surpass the nutrient densities of average wild-capture fisheries. Extensive aquaculture systems that co-produce fish and rice had the lowest environmental burdens in six out of seven metrics examined when the composition of all aquaculture systems was modified to include 50% SIS. Nutrition-sensitive aquaculture that provides greater human health benefits and minimizes environmental impacts is a key societal challenge that requires targeted interventions and supportive policies. Aquaculture production systems in Bangladesh were configured to optimize the supply of micronutrients while minimizing environmental impacts. Increased production of small indigenous species enabled nutrient densities of farmed fish to match those of wild-caught fish, and systems that co-produce fish and rice had the lowest environmental burdens.","2020-10","2020-11-17 20:34:27","2023-12-07 17:41:25","","640–647","","10","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Sustainability; Postdoc; 2020; Year 6; F:Water & People; T:Fisheries; T:Human Health & Well-Being; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; 2016PF-029; T:Coasts & Shorelines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the “cocaine module” of the Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB), and by U.S. law it is the exclusive source for performance data on key aspects of the drug interdiction mission, one of the foundations of U.S. supply-side drug policy. Nevertheless, the dataset remains poorly known or used among drug policy researchers despite being unclassified. To make the existence and strengths of this dataset better known, this paper describes its provenance, ongoing production, and analytical utility. Methods:  The analysis draws on the archive of reports produced by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent, non-partisan entity that has been tracking U.S. government agencies’ drug war accounting for almost 50 years. The analysis also relies on third-party assessments of interdiction, and on correspondence with staff in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Results: The CCDB emerged in the 1990s following two decades of drug war failures in the transit zone. It is an “all source” product, which curates data from a variety of sources produced by the 26 U.S. agencies and 20 foreign partners involved in transit zone interdiction. There is a high threshold for inclusion of cocaine trafficking events into the CCDB; it therefore offers a highly reliable yet conservative representation of cocaine trafficking and counternarcotic response. Instances of CCDB data in the public record yield several insights: a) the volume of cocaine moving annually through the transit zone has for the past decade well exceeded 1,000 MT/year; b) cocaine seizures in the transit zone are greater than anywhere else, and significantly higher than indicated by the UNODC's World Drug Reports; c) interdiction appears to have little to no effect on cocaine prices in the U.S.; d) interdiction is highly “outcome-ineffective”; in FY2018, for example, the U.S. and partners intercepted only 6% of the cocaine trafficking events known to have occurred in the transit zone that year; e) traffickers respond quickly and constantly to interdiction by shifting their routes and transport strategies. Conclusion The CCDB deserves greater attention from researchers as a high-quality dataset that: a) challenges the “unknowability” of illicit activities and underscores the need for better sharing of unclassified government data; b) opens up new ways of exploring drug enforcement policies and actions in transit areas; c) contradicts rosy assessments of drug interdiction effectiveness by unequivocally demonstrating interdiction's longstanding and persistent failure and thus the need for fundamentally different approaches.","2020-06","2020-11-17 20:34:28","2023-12-07 17:41:25","","102719","","","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QKVTMI8E/McSweeney - 2020 - Reliable drug war data The Consolidated Counterdr.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QQVEIL2K/S0955395920300608.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 5; 2020; T:Policy & Regulation; 2015C12-030; K:drug trafficking; K:cocaine; K:Data; K:Drug war, Central America; K:Interdiction; K:Supply-side policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly, there are high expectations that the enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) will drive large-scale forest recovery and carbon mitigation. In this study, we quantified the potential role that ongoing forest regeneration may play in offsetting deficits from private properties with less vegetation cover than determined by the BFC, considering different law implementation settings. Focusing on the Amazon Biome, we overlaid property level data from a mandatory registry (≈ 250,000 properties) onto land cover maps to quantify on-site forest deficit offsets by ongoing forest recovery. Similarly, we estimated the share of regrowing forests in private properties potentially eligible for off-site deficit compensation (i.e. via market-based forest certificates trade). Regrowing forests could reduce, on-site, 3.2 Mha of forests deficits, decreasing non-compliance from private properties by 35%. Likewise, forest certificates availability increased by 3.4 Mha when we included regrowing forests in the calculations. This means an increase in the forest certificate offer-demand ratio from 0.9 to 2.0. On the one hand, trading certificates issued from recovering forests may represent a low-cost strategy for compliance with the BFC, a pathway for achieving restoration targets, and an additional source of income for landholders. To meet this potential, it is necessary to better conceptualize second-growth forests, advancing the poor definitions presented by the BFC, and offer an operational basis for their protection. On the other hand, including regrowing forests' certificates in compensation schemes may further restrain the potential of the trading mechanism for conservation of unprotected old-growth forests and lead to positive net carbon emissions. We highlight that the BFC implementation must be carefully regulated to maximize synergies between compliance and forest resources conservation and enhancement.","2019-11","2020-11-17 20:30:08","2023-12-07 17:41:25","","","","","88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NHPP8VMH/Hissa et al. - 2019 - Regrowing forests contribution to law compliance and carbon storage in private properties of the Brazilian Amazon.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4E4DKBP2/S0264837718313887.html","","no acknowledgment; T:Economics; T:Climate Change; 2018PF-038; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; F:Ecosystem Services; Year 8; K:Additionality; K:Brazilian Forest Code; K:Forest carbon; K:Forest recovery; K:Governance; K:Offsetting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on recreational use are critical for informing management of recreation resources, however, managers often lack actionable information on visitor use for large protected areas that lack controlled access points. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential for social media data (e.g., geotagged images shared on Flickr and trip reports shared on a hiking forum) to provide land managers with useful measures of recreational use to dispersed areas, and to provide lessons learned from comparing several more traditional counting methods. First, we measure daily and monthly visitation rates to individual trails within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest (MBSNF) in western Washington. At 15 trailheads, we compare counts of hikers from infrared sensors, timelapse cameras, and manual on-site counts, to counts based on the number of shared geotagged images and trip reports from those locations. Second, we measure visitation rates to each National Forest System (NFS) unit across the US and compare annual measurements derived from the number of geotagged images to estimates from the US Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring Program. At both the NFS unit and the individual-trail scales, we found strong correlations between traditional measures of recreational use and measures based on user-generated content shared on the internet. For national forests in every region of the country, correlations between official Forest Service statistics and geotagged images ranged between 55% and 95%. For individual trails within the MBSNF, monthly visitor counts from on-site measurements were strongly correlated with counts from geotagged images (79%) and trip reports (91%). The convenient, cost-efficient and timely nature of collecting and analyzing user-generated data could allow land managers to monitor use over different seasons of the year and at sites and scales never previously monitored, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of recreational use patterns and values.","2018-09","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:41:25","","465–474","","","222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","64 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Academic Press","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/V5IMAMK8/Fisher et al. - 2018 - Recreational use in dispersed public lands measure.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/YTHDU9SP/S030147971830570X.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; T:Social Science; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Natural Resource Management; 2014T10-020; K:Geotagged photographs; K:Social media; K:Conservation areas; K:National forests; K:Public lands; K:Recreation; K:Visitation rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from 89 studies worldwide, we examined responses to the reduction or cessation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs relative to baseline conditions. Baseline conditions were pre-disturbance conditions, undisturbed reference sites, restoration targets, or experimental controls. We estimated recovery completeness (% baseline conditions reached) and recovery rate (annual % change relative to baseline conditions) for plant and animal abundance and diversity and for ecosystem functions. Categories were considered fully recovered if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of recovery completeness overlapped 100% and partially recovered if the CI did not overlap either 100% or zero. Cessation of nutrient inputs did not result in more complete or faster recovery than partial nutrient reductions, due likely to insufficient passage of time, nutrients from other sources, or shifting baselines. Together, lakes and coastal marine areas achieved 34% (±16% CI) and 24% (±15% CI) of baseline conditions decades after the cessation or partial reduction of nutrients, respectively. One third of individual response variables showed no change or worsened conditions, suggesting that achieving baseline conditions may not be possible in all cases. Implied recovery times after cessation of nutrient inputs varied widely, from < 1 yr to nearly a century, depending on response. Our results suggest that long-term monitoring is needed to better understand recovery timescales and trajectories and that policy measures must consider the potential for slow and partial recovery.","2016-10","2020-11-17 20:35:26","2023-12-07 17:41:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","146 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7CNTEUI6/McCrackin et al. - 2017 - Recovery of lakes and coastal marine ecosystems fr.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/K45F7D5D/lno.html","","Pursuit; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; 2016; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; T:Pollution; Year 3; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2013T7-015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A choice experiment was used to assess willingness to pay as a function of the abundance and size of reef fishes, the presence of fishing activity/gear, and dive price. Despite some preference heterogeneity both between and within sites, the results indicate that future declines in the abundance of reef fishes, and particularly in the number of large fishes observed on recreational dives, will result in significant reductions in diver consumer surplus. On the other hand, improvements in fish populations and reduced fishing gear encounters are likely to result in significant economic gains. These results can be used to justify investment in pre-emptive management strategies targeted at improving reef fish stocks (namely reducing unsustainable fishing activities and land-based reef impacts), managing conflicting uses, as well as to indicate a possible source of financing for such conservation activities.","2015-03","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:41:24","","48–57","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9C7KQZXL/Gill et al. - 2015 - Recreational diver preferences for reef fish attri.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4NDUEUXF/S0921800915000178.html","","Year 4; no acknowledgment; T:Economics; 2015; Postdoc; F:Water & People; T:Ocean & Marine Life; T:Fisheries; 2014PF-011; K:Choice experiment; K:Coastal tourism; K:Coral reef management; K:Resource economics; K:SCUBA diving; K:Willingness to pay (WTP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For these land use types, we determined the historical land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method to determine Ks values in the field. We also measured tree basal area, canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in forest covers. The Ks decreased when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions.

Substantial uncertainties exist in modeling canopy water interception and related hydrological processes due to rainfall forcing frequency selection and varying canopy traits. Here we design a new time interpolation method “zero” to better represent convective-type precipitation in tropical regions. We also implement and recalibrate plant functional type-specific interception parameters for rainforests and oil palm plantations, where oil palms express higher water interception capacity than forests, using the Community Land Model (CLM) versions 4.5 and 5.0 with CLM-Palm embedded. Reconciling the interception scheme with realistic precipitation forcing produces more accurate canopy evaporation and transpiration for both plant functional types, which in turn improves simulated evapotranspiration and energy partitioning when benchmarked against observations from our study sites in Indonesia and an extensive literature review. Regional simulations for Sumatra and Kalimantan show that industrial oil palm plantations have 18–27% higher transpiration and 15–20% higher evapotranspiration than forests on an annual regional average basis across different ages or successional stages, even though the forests experience higher average precipitation according to reanalysis data. Our land-only modeling results indicate that current oil palm plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan use 15–20% more water (mean 220 mm or 20 Gt) per year compared to lowland rainforests of the same extent. The extra water use by oil palm reduces soil moisture and runoff that could affect ecosystem services such as productivity of staple crops and availability of drinking water in rural areas.","2019-02","2020-11-17 20:34:42","2023-12-07 17:41:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IUT249SF/Fan et al. - 2019 - Reconciling Canopy Interception Parameterization a.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/D6KX2DBZ/2018MS001490.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; 2016C13-002; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; 2019; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:land use change; K:oil palm; K:canopy interception; K:Community Land Model; K:evapotranspiration; K:forcing frequency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It would benefit also from: (1) stakeholder engagement and participatory processes, (2) societal and institutional continuity in science and decisions evaluation and follow-through, and (3) recognition and understanding of the role of biases, beliefs, heuristics, and values (BBHV) in decision-making. We suggest that creating multi-media, efficiently accessible, ""Records of Engagement"" (RoE) could support meeting the above needs. RoE would offer: (1) a reward system to support and foster stakeholder engagement; (2) a record structure for evaluating processes and outcomes and for learning and knowledge transfer, and (3) an opportunity to systematize, facilitate, create efficiencies, and improve the engagement of experts and stakeholders in participatory modeling, planning and policy development. RoE, in our view, should also not only describe scientific evidence and lines of argumentation but also BBHV and emotions expressed, a first step in understanding their impacts on decision making and management of CHN systems. We seek to engage readers to help us determine how to create RoE, including what they might contain to be most useful. Preliminary thoughts are offered on RoE framework design and content, and on a Decision Tracking System and methodologies that could be used to support creation and use of RoE.

This new approach to governance is of particular importance on rivers within or shared by countries in which water management is fragmented among national and sub-national levels of government as well as among governmental sectors. This article focuses on the Columbia River Basin, in the United States and Canada. Review of the Columbia River Treaty governing shared management of the river has opened a public dialogue on river governance. Treaty review coincides with change in both the biophysical setting and the values and capacity of basin residents. Climate change is altering the timing of flow relied on by the management of developed river infrastructure and the annual runs of the basins' salmonid species. River development increased economic development in the basin, but at the cost of ecosystem function. Assertion of legal rights by indigenous communities has brought an alternative world view to the review—one that seeks to maintain the benefits of river development while reconciling that development with ecosystem function. This article identifies the governance mechanisms needed to achieve reconciliation and describes their emergence in the Columbia River Basin through an analytical framework focused on local capacity building and network formation across jurisdictions, sectors, and scales of governance. Both countries fragment water management authority among jurisdictions and sectors, but bridging organizations have emerged to link interests and government at the watershed and basin scale. Emergence of new governance is facilitated by increases in local, regional, and indigenous governance capacity. This networked governance emerging at the biophysical scale while embedded in and linked to a hierarchy of formal international, national, state, and local government is characterized as the ecology of governance.","2018-05","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:41:24","","1–14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7HMK5MX4/Cosens et al. - 2018 - Reconciliation of development and ecosystems the .pdf","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 2; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:water governance; 2013T5-006; K:networked governance; K:Panarchy; K:Columbia River Basin; K:international rivers; K:new environmental governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focused on studies that assessed rates or associated times of entire biotic interactions, such as time to consumption of all prey, rather than rates of components of these interactions, such as prey encounter rate. Results were: 1) the frequency distribution of E for each interaction type was typically peaked and right skewed; 2) the overall mean is E= 0.96 eV and median E= 0.78 eV; 3) there was significant variation in E within but not across interaction types; but 4) average values of E were not significantly different from 0.65 eV by interaction type and 5) studies with measurements at more temperatures were more consistent with E= 0.65 eV. These synthetic findings suggest that, despite the many complicating factors, the temperature-dependence of rates of biotic interactions broadly reflect of rates of metabolism, a relationship with important implications for a warming world.","2014-12","2020-11-17 20:35:28","2023-12-07 17:41:23","","1449–1456","","12","123","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","35 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5HGQB37Q/Burnside et al. - 2014 - Rates of biotic interactions scale predictably wit.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IV22ANSA/oik.html","","no acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; Year 2; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Ecology; 2014; 2012PF-004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultural multilevel selection (CMLS) is a theoretical framework derived from theories of cultural evolution and cultural group selection that emphasizes pressures affecting different levels of social organization as well as conflicts among these levels. As such, CMLS can be useful for understanding many environmental challenges. With this paper, we use evidence from the literature and hypothetical scenarios to show how the framework can be used to understand the emergence and persistence of sustainable social–ecological systems. We apply the framework to the Balinese system of rice production and focus on two important cultural traits (synchronized cropping and the institutions and rituals associated with water management). We use data from the literature that discusses bottom-up (self-organized, complex adaptive system) and top-down explanations for the system and discuss how (1) the emergence of group structure, (2) group-level variation in cropping strategies, institutions, and rituals, and (3) variation in overall yields as a result of different strategies and institutions, could have allowed for the spread of group-beneficial traits and the increasing complexity of the system. We also outline cultural transmission mechanisms that can explain the spread of group-beneficial traits in Bali and describe the kinds of data that would be required to validate the framework in forward-looking studies.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:41:23","","1–13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CHLAR7J6/Brooks et al. - 2018 - Re-examining balinese subaks through the lens of c.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; T:Agriculture; T:Anthropology/Human Ecology; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Venture; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Year 3; K:collective action; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:social-ecological systems; 2014V-028; K:cultural multilevel selection; K:common pool resource; K:cultural transmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed and applied a multidisciplinary approach to define, map, and examine changes in the spatial extent and structure of both the landscapes and human populations of SSF in the United States. We estimated that the SSF in the contiguous United States, which are home to only 6–7% of the population, account for over 60% of all forested land and over 30% of all land. From 1990 to 2010 SSF declined in area by 16%, changing little overall but declining markedly in proximity to urban perimeters. A PCA ordination and cluster analysis of the human and landscape characteristics of SSF areas revealed complex and regionally variable patterns. Very broadly, SSF in the far northern and western states are less densely settled and more amenity driven, while the southeastern states north through Pennsylvania and Ohio are more densely settled and more agricultural. The socioeconomic characteristics of SSF are often quite variable at fine scales, especially in proximity to urban areas. Our improved multidisciplinary understanding of SSF raises important questions about regional differences in the dynamics, structure and future socioeconomic trajectories of these forests. To best manage these landscapes for the sake of both human and natural systems, SSF need to be considered a distinct land classification in their own right, not merely perceived as fuzzy boundaries around wild lands or urban areas.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:41:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7APPGU36/Van Berkel et al. - 2018 - Recognizing the ‘sparsely settled forest’ Multi-d.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/HX7P5QVK/S0169204617302888.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2012T1-006; 2017; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; F:Land & Human Dynamics; K:Coupled natural and human systems; K:Exemplar Clustering Analysis (ECA); K:Geographic classification; K:Land change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there has been extensive research on the development of methods and tools for conservation planning, especially spatial planning, comparatively little is known about the relative importance of ecological versus non-ecological data for prioritization, or the likely return on investment of incorporating better data. We demonstrate a simple approach for (1) quantifying the sensitivity of spatial planning results to different ecological and non-ecological data layers, and (2) estimating the potential gains in efficiency from incorporating additional data. Our case study involves spatial planning for coastal squeeze, a process by which development blocks coastal ecosystems from moving landward in response to sea-level rise. We show that incorporating spatial data on landowners' likelihood of selling had little effect on identifying relative priorities but drastically changed the outlook for whether conservation goals could be achieved. Better data on the costs of conservation actions had the greatest potential to improve the efficiency of spatial planning, in some cases generating more than an order of magnitude greater cost savings compared to ecological data. Our framework could be applied to other systems to guide the development of spatial planning and to identify general rules of thumb for the importance of alternative data sources for conservation problems in different socio-ecological contexts.","2019-12","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:41:22","","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8R78K5UY/Field and Elphick - 2019 - Quantifying the return on investment of social and.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/SV4XLERR/Field and Elphick - 2019 - Quantifying the return on investment of social and.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Economics; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; C:Case Study; 2019; T:Conservation; Year 7; T:Coasts & Shorelines; 2017PF-036","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With an urgent need to feed the world's growing population and the growing concern over nutrient pollution and climate change, sustainable nutrient management has become a major challenge for this century. To address this challenge, the growing body of research on nutrient budgets, namely the nutrient inputs and outputs of a given system, has provided great opportunities for improving scientific knowledge of the complex nutrient cycles in the coupled human and natural systems. This knowledge can help inform stakeholders, such as farmers, consumers, and policy makers, on their decisions related to nutrient management. This paper systematically reviews major challenges, as well as opportunities, in defining, quantifying, and applying nutrient budgets. Nutrient budgets have been defined for various systems with different research or application purposes, but the lack of consistency in the system definition and its budget terms has hindered intercomparison among studies and experience-sharing among researchers and regions. Our review synthesizes existing nutrient budgets under a framework with five systems (i.e., Soil-Plant system, Animal system, Animal-Plant-Soil system, Agro-Food system, and Landscape system) and four spatial scales (i.e., Plot and Farm, Watershed, National, and Global scales). We define these systems and identify issues of nitrogen and phosphorus budgets within each. Few nutrient budgets have been well balanced at any scale, due to the large uncertainties in the quantification of several major budget terms. The type and level of challenges vary across spatial scales and also differ among nutrients. Improvement in nutrient budgets will rely not only on the technological advancement of scientific observations and models but also on better bookkeeping of human activity data. While some nutrient budget terms may need decades, or even centuries, of research to be well quantified within desirable levels of uncertainties, it is imperative to effectively communicate to interested stakeholders our understanding of nutrient budgets so that scientists and a variety of stakeholders can work together to address the sustainable nutrient management challenge of this century.","2020-03","2020-11-17 20:30:02","2023-12-07 17:41:22","","","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","87 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/L9L37FC5/Zhang et al. - 2020 - Quantifying Nutrient Budgets for Sustainable Nutrient Management.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WSAS39XY/Zhang et al. - 2020 - Quantifying Nutrient Budgets for Sustainable Nutri.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6RC8S3YJ/2018GB006060.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; 2020; Year 7; T:Pollution; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017C17-025; F:Food Systems & the Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a framework built around the concept that migratory species act as carriers, delivering benefit flows to people throughout their annual cycle that are supported by the network of ecosystems upon which the species depend. We apply this framework to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration of eastern North America by calculating their spatial subsidies. Spatial subsidies are the net ecosystem service flows throughout a species' range and a quantitative measure of the spatial mismatch between the locations where people receive most benefits and the locations of habitats that most support the species. Results indicate cultural benefits provided by monarchs in the U.S. and Canada are subsidized by migration and overwintering habitat in Mexico. At a finer scale, throughout the monarch range, habitat in rural landscapes subsidizes urban residents. Understanding the spatial distribution of benefits derived from and ecological support provided to monarchs and other migratory species offers a promising means of understanding the costs and benefits associated with conservation across jurisdictional borders.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:08","2023-12-07 17:41:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Year 1; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Conservation; Workshop; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Fellow; F:Research Frameworks; K:migration; 2012W-002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stakeholders and practitioners often lack the resources for such intensive efforts. Furthermore, most end with problem framing and fail to explicitly address trade-offs and uncertainty. To remedy this gap, we developed a rapid survey assessment that compares the relative resilience of social-ecological systems with respect to a number of resilience properties. This approach generates large amounts of information relative to stakeholder inputs. We targeted four stakeholder categories: government (policy, regulation, management), end users (farmers, ranchers, landowners, industry), agency/public science (research, university, extension), and NGOs (environmental, citizen, social justice) in four North American watersheds, to assess social-ecological resilience through surveys. Conceptually, social-ecological systems are comprised of components ranging from strictly human to strictly ecological, but that relate directly or indirectly to one another. They have soft boundaries and several important dimensions or axes that together describe the nature of social-ecological interactions, e.g., variability, diversity, modularity, slow variables, feedbacks, capital, innovation, redundancy, and ecosystem services. There is no absolute measure of resilience, so our design takes advantage of cross-watershed comparisons and therefore focuses on relative resilience. Our approach quantifies and compares the relative resilience across watershed systems and potential trade-offs among different aspects of the social-ecological system, e.g., between social, economic, and ecological contributions. This approach permits explicit assessment of several types of uncertainty (e.g., self-assigned uncertainty for stakeholders; uncertainty across respondents, watersheds, and subsystems), and subjectivity in perceptions of resilience among key actors and decision makers and provides an efficient way to develop the mental models that inform our stakeholders and stakeholder categories.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:41:22","","art3","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: The Resilience Alliance","","","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 2; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; 2013T5-006; K:resilience assessment; K:social-ecological system; K:coupled human-natural system; K:stressed watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As communities, regulatory agencies, and policy-makers plan for rising seas, it is important to recognize the landscapes of race and deep histories of racism that have shaped the socio-ecological formations of coastal regions. If this history goes unrecognized, what we label colorblind adaptation planning is likely to perpetuate what Rob Nixon calls the “slow violence” of environmental racism, characterized by policies that benefit some populations while abandoning others. By colorblind adaptation planning, we refer to vulnerability mitigation and adaptation planning projects that altogether overlook racial inequality—or worse dismiss its systemic causes and explain away racial inequality by attributing racial disparities to non-racial causes. We contend that responses to sea-level rise must be attuned to racial difference and structures of racial inequality. In this article, we combine the theory of racial formation with the geographical study of environmental justice and point to the ways racial formations are also environmental. We examine vulnerability to sea-level rise through the process of racial coastal formation on Sapelo Island, Georgia, specifically analyzing its deep history, the uneven racial development of land ownership and employment, and barriers to African American participation and inclusion in adaptation planning. Racial coastal formation's potential makes way for radical transformation in climate change science not only in coastal areas, but other spaces as situated territorial racial formations.","2017-12","2020-11-17 20:35:10","2023-12-07 17:41:22","","62–72","","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","122 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Pergamon","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/DHMHSR2Z/Hardy et al. - 2017 - Racial coastal formation The environmental injust.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/C7EPQW8V/S0016718517302944.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; Year 6; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Vulnerability; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2016PF-028; K:sea level rise; K:sea-level rise; T:Coasts & Shorelines; K:Gullah Geechee; K:Georgia; K:Political ecology; K:Race","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined 120 planning documents from 19 U.S. cities to identify if and how the stated benefits that cities use within their rationales for green infrastructure programs (rationale statements) align with the criteria used to site green infrastructure at the neighborhood scale (siting statements). Our findings suggest that many of the desired benefits stated in the rationales for green infrastructure lack corresponding and specific siting criteria. This was particularly evident for rationale statements concerning social and cultural ecosystem services, seemingly because certain benefits, especially those related to stormwater management, are prioritized over other green infrastructure services. While multiple benefits remain a dominant rationale for green infrastructure in the cities analyzed, including stormwater management, social cohesion, and biodiversity benefits, siting criteria were dominated by stormwater management, available locations, and other logistical considerations. These findings indicate a large-scale misalignment between the multifunctional ideal of urban green infrastructure and the procedures used to implement green infrastructure programs. We conclude with a discussion of how siting criteria and processes can be elaborated to deliver the desired benefits of green infrastructure.","2023-05","2023-05-30 16:34:24","2024-05-06 19:35:51","2023-05-30 16:34:24","104781","","","237","","Landscape and Urban Planning","Why go green?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BCUW8NXL/Hoover et al. - 2023 - Why go green Comparing rationales and planning cr.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/97E3G445/S0169204623001007.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; reported to NSF; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Actionable Research; Year 9; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2023; K:Nature-based solutions; K:green infrastructure; 2019PF-047; K:urban planning; K:Environmental justice; K:Urban green infrastructure; K:Urban planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the case for rabies, a viral disease of mammals. While Carnivora (carnivores) and Chiroptera (bats) are the canonical mammalian orders known to be responsible for the maintenance and onward transmission of rabies Lyssavirus (RABV), the role of most species within these orders remains unknown and is continually changing as a result of contemporary host shifting. We combined a trait-based analytical approach with gradient boosting machine learning models to identify physiological and ecological host features associated with being a reservoir for RABV. We then used a cooperative game theory approach to determine species-specific traits associated with known RABV reservoirs. Being a carnivore reservoir for RABV was associated with phylogenetic similarity to known RABV reservoirs, along with other traits such as having larger litters and earlier sexual maturity. For bats, location in the Americas and geographic range were the most important predictors of RABV reservoir status, along with having a large litter. Our models identified 44 carnivore and 34 bat species that are currently not recognized as RABV reservoirs, but that have trait profiles suggesting their capacity to be or become reservoirs. Further, our findings suggest that potential reservoir species among bats and carnivores occur both within and outside of areas with current RABV circulation. These results show the ability of a trait-based approach to detect potential reservoirs of infection and could inform rabies control programs and surveillance efforts by identifying the types of species and traits that facilitate RABV maintenance and transmission.","2020-12-08","2024-05-06 18:47:23","2024-05-06 19:35:26","2024-05-06 18:47:23","e0008940","","12","14","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/EKU5JRBB/Worsley-Tonks et al. - 2020 - Using host traits to predict reservoir host specie.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; 2020; T:Disease & Pests; 2018PF-040; K:Bats","Wildlife; Carnivory; Foxes; Fruit bats; Phylogenetics; Rabies; Species delimitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, stored SOC may become vulnerable to decomposition where climate and land use change alter wetland hydrology. Seasonally saturated wetlands experience fluctuating hydrologic conditions that could promote physicochemical mechanisms known to stabilize terrestrial SOC. These wetlands are therefore likely to be important for SOC storage at the landscape-scale. This study examined physicochemical stabilization of SOC within five seasonally saturated wetlands across a hydrologic gradient from the frequently saturated basin edge to the rarely saturated upland. At each wetland, we monitored water level and collected soil samples from the top two mineral horizons across five transect points to quantify physical protection of SOC in aggregates and organo-mineral associations between SOC and iron (Fe). As expected, both SOC concentrations and SOC stocks from 10–50 cm decreased across the transect from frequently saturated soils to rarely saturated soils. However, SOC stocks from 0–10 cm increased along this gradient, indicating diverging SOC dynamics throughout the soil profile. The majority of SOC was associated with macroaggregates across the transect, suggesting that macroaggregates are likely to physically protect wetland SOC during seasonal drying. By contrast, Fe-associated SOC was low across the transect, though modest accumulations of Fe (5 mg Fe g−1 soil) were observed in the transition zone where saturation was most dynamic throughout the year. Our results suggest that SOC stabilization occurs via physical protection within macroaggregates and, to a lesser extent, organo-mineral associations during dry periods in and around seasonally saturated wetlands. As climate scenarios predict intensified wet and dry cycles in many wetlands, understanding SOC stabilization is critical to predicting vulnerability to future change.","2022-05-11","2024-03-28 17:13:01","2024-05-06 18:33:16","2024-03-28 17:13:01","40","","5","42","","Wetlands","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6A3C3U3V/Kottkamp et al. - 2022 - Physical Protection in Aggregates and Organo-Miner.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; Postdoc; F:Biodiversity; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Year 7; T:Ecology; 2022; 2017PF-034; K:Organo-mineral associations; K:Physical protection of SOC in aggregates; K:Seasonally saturated wetlands; K:SOC stabilization; K:SOC stocks; K:Soil organic carbon (SOC); T:Ecosystems Services/Functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given these dynamics, it is often unclear which policies would best support sustainable land use and livelihoods in the future. There are multiple theories for how tenure, rules, social relations and environmental variability intersect to influence pastoral resource governance, but these have largely been developed based on empirical data from specific social and environmental contexts. Few studies have attempted to evaluate empirically how the factors driving pastoral management decisions might vary across a social-ecological gradient. In this work we attempt to reconcile the current diversity of theories around pastoral resource governance with an empirical dataset on household herd and pasture management decisions in Mongolia, where there is ongoing debate over proposed rangeland policies, including formalization of land tenure. We assess the relationship between theorized predictors of herder behavior (i.e. formal rights, formal rules, social capital, and environmental variability), and household-level management decisions about pastoral mobility and storage. We compare our findings from a survey of 760 households across four ecozones to predictions from pastoral resource governance theories to assess which theories best match the complex realities on the ground. We observed a continuum of de facto pastoral governance regimes that roughly map onto a social-ecological gradient defined by (i) resource variability and predictability, and (ii) the relative prevalence of formal rule-based vs. implicit norm-based governance. We find that rules, social capital, and forage availability are the strongest predictors of whether a household will reserve forage, with consistent effects across ecological zones. In contrast, social ties and environmental conditions most strongly predict mobility practices. While most households reserved pastures regardless of tenure status, those households who do not reserve pastures are more likely to lack formal use rights. Our findings reinforce the importance of avoiding “one size fits all” rangeland governance policies. We demonstrate that herders make decisions in response to environmental productivity and variability over space and time, and that social ties and mobility are critical for maintaining access to forage. This may explain why many herders remain skeptical of formal pasture tenure, which could restrict this flexibility. Policies that ensure herders’ collective rights to pasture through large-scale zoning rather than tenure could potentially achieve both secure pasture rights and maximum flexibility.","2024-07-01","2024-05-06 15:34:25","2024-05-06 16:05:00","2024-05-06 15:34:24","107170","","","142","","Land Use Policy","Context matters","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8WBPPCWC/S0264837724001236.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Agriculture; Year 6; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; K:Mobility; 2016PF-022; 2024; K:Common pool resources; K:Institutional bricolage; K:Managed open access; K:Pastoral land tenure; K:Resource use norms; K:Social capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand the causes of these invasions, it is important to quantify the relative influence of principal drivers such as international imports and climatic effects. Location North America, Chile, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Time Period 1881–2020. Methods To evaluate the relative contributions of various factors in explaining global variation in numbers of non-native insect establishments in different world regions, we conducted two multivariate regression analyses to quantify temporal changes in family-level composition and native ranges of established non-native species in several world regions. Results There were temporal changes in the family-level composition of non-native species assemblages. Prior to 1900, invasions were dominated by scale insects, subsequently shifting to a more diverse set of species, except in North America, which had relatively small compositional change over time compared to other regions. Spatial and temporal variation in the composition of established species was associated with differences in the origin of imports and climatic factors, each explaining 26.3% and 27.4% of the total variation, respectively. The analysis of native ranges of non-native species indicated that there was no consistent temporal variation across all regions. Established species in New Zealand were predominantly native to Australasia and species in North America and Chile were mainly from Europe. Non-native species in Europe mainly originated from the Nearctic region while those in Japan and Australia generally originated from multiple regions. Climatic factors in the destination regions had a primary effect (66.3%) on variation in the native range of established species, although imports also had substantial effects (45.4%). Main Conclusions Geographical variation in climate and imports act together as drivers of establishment success for non-native insects in all six regions.","","2024-05-03 17:09:32","2024-05-03 18:54:52","2024-05-03 17:09:32","e13844","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada and The Authors.

Scholars have argued that such analyses can improve our understanding of present challenges and offer useful lessons to guide adaptation responses. Yet despite considerable differences between past and present societies, our inherently limited knowledge of the past and our changing understanding of it, much of this research uses historical antecedents uncritically, assuming that past societal impacts and responses are directly analogous to contemporary ones. We argue that this approach is unsound both methodologically and theoretically, thus drawing insights that might offer an erroneous course of action. To illustrate the challenges in drawing historical analogies, we outline several fundamental differences between past and present societies as well as broader limitations of historical research. Based on these points, we argue that scholars who apply historical inference in their work should do so critically, while reflecting on the objectives of learning from the past and the limitations of this process. We suggest a number of ways to improve past-present analogies, such as defining more explicitly what we can learn from the past, clarifying the rationale for using the analogy, and reducing the number of variables compared between past and present.","2022-07","2023-06-05 17:02:59","2024-05-03 18:47:05","2023-06-05 17:02:59","102570","","","76","","Global Environmental Change","Can we learn from the past?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6LTDNWWH/Tubi et al. - 2022 - Can we learn from the past Towards better analogi.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NR7XQ54F/S095937802200108X.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; T:Resilience; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Postdoc; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Vulnerability; Year 9; 2022; T:Disturbance; T:Environmental History; T:Humanities; 2019C21-011; T:Climate change; K:Adaptation; K:Environmental change; K:Historical analogies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is one of the most biodiverse and urbanized regions of the world, which makes it imperative to understand how greening policies have impacted the distribution, accessibility, and quantity of vegetated areas in cities through time. Using a landscape ecology approach, we explored the effects of local urban dynamics on the pathways of urban vegetation in ten LAC capital cities in the last 20 years. Our results showed a great fluctuation of vegetation cover change for the region, with Santiago (Chile) losing more than 10% of its urban vegetation to Brasilia gaining 19%, while fragmentation and inequities in the distribution of vegetation increased in all cities. Cities followed four pathways of vegetation change, displaying different patterns of change in fragmentation, size of the vegetated patches and their clustering. This discloses that the greening policies and actions adopted in LAC cities led to increased vegetation cover, or avoided its loss, but did not assure a better distribution of the green and its benefits. Vegetation in LAC cities are still fragmented, where vegetation is not connected and is not equitably distributed, showing that policies in place have not addressed distributional injustice yet. This is corroborated by the assessment of drivers of change where we found social factors were the most important determinants of urban vegetation dynamics. Results from our study provide evidence for developing policies towards urban greening and connectivity, not only to prevent further biodiversity loss but also for creating more resilient communities and cities that address environmental inequities.","2023-11-01","2024-03-14 17:00:51","2024-03-14 17:04:18","2024-03-14 17:00:51","106912","","","134","","Land Use Policy","Are we promoting green cities in Latin America and the Caribbean?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ZPG4KRLC/S0264837723003782.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Workshop; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; Year 9; 2023; K:Environmental justice; 2019W-087; K:Democracy; K:Gini index","Fragmentation; Greening policies; Urban vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In alignment with the European Commission’s sustainability objectives and U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, this study explores the potential energy and environmental footprint savings achievable by halving FLW in Europe by 2030. Using a multiregional input–output model, we estimated the total global energy and environmental footprint savings across all stages of the food supply chain, considering industry-specific FLW rates and proportion weights. The findings reveal substantial environmental savings across Europe, with aggregate savings potentially reaching 51 Mt CO2e (0.09 t CO2e/p), 4,620 Mm3 (8 m3/p) of blue water, 106,446 km2 (179 m2/p) of cropland, 55,523 km2 (93 m2/p) of grassland, and 0.47 EJ (0.54 TJ/p) of energy. The greatest potential for savings was found in Western Europe, specifically in France, Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands. However, countries with a lower per capita GDP, such as Greece, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania, also demonstrate significant per capita savings potential, indicating that wealth does not necessarily correlate with higher environmental savings. Agricultural production emerged as the stage with the highest footprint reduction potential for GHG and resource footprints across Europe, while the foodservice and institutional stages offer the greatest energy-saving potential. Geographical disparities underscore the need for region-specific policies. These results challenge the wealth-sustainability correlation and advocate for adaptable policies that transcend national wealth and accommodate regional disparities, underlining the pivotal roles of the agricultural production and consumption stages in footprint savings.","2023-10-31","2024-03-14 16:57:20","2024-03-14 16:59:08","2024-03-14 16:57:20","16296-16308","","43","57","","Environ.

We assessed (1) social acceptance of offshore aquaculture in the Florida Gulf Coast using public comments; (2) site suitability for offshore development using social, biological, and technical data; and (3) potential impacts of offshore aquaculture on communities using socioeconomic vulnerability indices. We found that many stakeholders distrust policymakers and industry and have concerns about potential environmental impacts. We created species-specific suitability maps for red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and almaco jack (Seriola rivoliana), demonstrating that large areas of the Gulf are suitable for offshore aquaculture development. We show that many coastal and fishing-reliant communities have existing vulnerabilities that aquaculture development could affect, but the public comments did not reflect these.

Structural shifts in community-natural resource interactions may be expressed as “shocks”, or disruptions that create community change across multiple scales. These shocks may be isolated or connected events, and frequently have associated ripple effects. Our objectives were to (1) identify community shocks based on local resident perspectives, (2) evaluate regional variability of resident-perceived shock events, and (3) assess variation in perceptions of shocks between newer in-migrant and long-term residents. We used a mail survey to collect data from residents in rural New York, Ohio, Maine, and West Virginia (USA). Rather than starting with designated perspectives from past research, we used an inductive approach to identify shock events and their impacts. Categories of major shock events included, but were not limited to, employment loss, land transfers and designations, infrastructure development, loss of institutions, and natural disasters. Each community's history, shocks, and outcomes were uniquely place-dependent. Shocks identified and perception of them varied by residential tenure. Although identified similarly in a general sense by all respondents, details about individual shocks were more elaborately described by long-term residents, and in-migrants conveyed awareness of historical shocks. Conceptualizations of discrete, identifiable, and individual “shock” events are too simple and narrow for elucidating ongoing community perturbations that accumulate, counteract, and influence each other.","2024-01-01","2024-03-12 19:56:27","2024-03-12 20:10:14","2024-03-12 19:56:27","103188","","","105","","Journal of Rural Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A3MF5XXY/Walrath et al. - 2024 - Rural forested community shocks as perceived by in.pdf","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; 2012T1-006; Pursuit; Year 1; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Vulnerability; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Disturbance; K:Shocks; 2024; K:Forest-based rural communities; K:Place-based perspective; K:Regional variability; K:Resident-defined change; K:Rural community change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The blooms can affect human health, aquatic ecosystems, and the local economy. The effects can vary across communities in the Lake Erie Basin due to local socioeconomic status and dependence on lake resources. Therefore, it is crucial to identify HAB-vulnerable populations and regions to adjust regional governance strategies and allocate resources for government support. This study introduces a 5-theme spatial HAB vulnerability index (HAB-VI) comprised of socioeconomic, resource dependence, and spatial factors affecting vulnerability to HAB events. Using a multi-factor hierarchical model, it also applies the index to evaluate the HAB-related vulnerabilities of 50 counties in the Lake Erie Basin. Uncertainty analysis is an essential step to assess the robustness of the model and the stability of the calculated indices. The research utilizes a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty analysis and visualizes the statistical results of the simulation runs to indicate the variability and reliability of the HAB-VI rankings. Comparing thematic maps of the generated HAB-VI rankings, indicators of local governance strength, and nonpoint nutrient loads provides further insights into prioritizing the regions for government support and building community resilience.","2024-01-08","2024-03-12 19:46:53","2024-03-12 19:53:11","2024-03-12 19:46:53","","","","","","Appl.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain such asymmetries, including differences in propagule pressure, source species (invader) pools, environmental features in recipient regions, or biological traits of invaders. We quantified spatiotemporal patterns in the exchange of non-native insects between Europe, North America, and Australasia, and then tested possible explanations for these patterns based on regional trade (import values) and model estimates of invader pool sizes. Europe was the dominant donor of non-native insect species between the three regions, with most of this asymmetry arising prior to 1950. This could not be explained by differences in import values (1827–2014), nor were there substantial differences in the sizes of modelled invader pools.

Considering the unequal burden of natural hazards on socially vulnerable populations, we ask here, how are characteristics of social vulnerability associated with wildfire occurrence nationwide, at different scales and across differing levels of wildland–urban interface development? To answer this question, we first identify all non-urban census tracts in the USA that have experienced a wildfire since 1984. Using 26 different measures of social vulnerability, we compare these tracts to non-urban census tracts that have not experienced a wildfire. In doing so, we identify notable social vulnerabilities in areas that have experienced wildfire, including higher unemployment, higher employment in extractive industries, higher percentage of people living in mobile homes, higher percentages of Native Americans, higher percentage of people with less than 12th grade education, and higher populations of people with special needs. Breaking our data into eight regions and comparing tracts with a high proportion of wildland–urban interface (WUI) to those with a low proportion of WUI, we find that these characteristics are generally consistent across regions of the USA and vary slightly between high WUI and low WUI tracts. Overall, we find a robust pattern of higher social vulnerability in areas with wildfire occurrence. Whereas previous studies about social vulnerability to wildfire focus on relationships with wildfire hazard potential or concentrate on a single region, this study fills a knowledge gap by examining the relationship between social vulnerability and wildfire occurrence nationwide.","2024-01-08","2024-03-11 18:12:20","2024-03-11 18:20:19","2024-03-11 18:12:20","","","","","","Nat Hazards","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/WFK2BJ64/Schumann et al. - 2024 - The geography of social vulnerability and wildfire.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; Pursuit; T:Human Geography; Year 7; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Marginalized & Indigenous Communities; T:Risk; T:Vulnerability; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; T:Human Health & Well-Being; T:Disturbance; K:hazards; K:Environmental justice; 2024; 2017C16-022; K:Census data; K:Rural geographies; K:Social vulnerability indicators; K:Wildfire; K:Wildland–urban interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results reveal an unfortunate divergence between the contexts in which local rulemaking tends to be found and the contexts in which it contributes to successful outcomes.

It then compares the 'interpretations' added to the Breviary of Alaric that modified laws on coins in the Theodosian Code to argue that these changes helped shape both the appearance and use of money in the Visigothic world and were thus a means of transforming governance in the post-Roman West.","","2024-03-05 20:26:21","2024-03-05 21:01:39","","374","","","","","","","Late Antique and Early Medieval Iberia","","","","Amsterdam University Press","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/S8U23AUB/Eisenberg - Experiments in Visigothic Rulership Minting and M.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Economics; Postdoc; Year 9; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2023; T:Environmental History; 2019PF-046; k:Breviary of Alaric; k:coinage; k:economy; k:monetary policy; k:Theodosian Code; k:Visigothic coins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a scaling framework to quantify ontogenetic size variation and assessed patterns of abundance, richness, productivity and light interception across life history strategies from >114,000 trees in a primary, neotropical forest. We classified trees along two life history axes: a fast–slow axis characterized by a growth–survival trade-off, and a stature–recruitment axis with tall, long-lived pioneers at one end and short, short-lived recruiters at the other. Relative abundance, richness, productivity and light interception follow an approximate power law, systematically shifting over an order of magnitude with tree size. Slow saplings dominate the understorey, but slow trees decline to parity with rapidly growing fast and long-lived pioneer species in the canopy. Like the community as a whole, slow species are the closest to obeying the energy equivalence rule (EER)—with equal productivity per size class—but other life histories strongly increase productivity with tree size. Productivity is fuelled by resources, and the scaling of light interception corresponds to the scaling of productivity across life history strategies, with slow and all species near solar energy equivalence. This points towards a resource-use corollary to the EER: the resource equivalence rule. Fitness trade-offs associated with tree size and life history may promote coexistence in tropical forests by limiting niche overlap and reducing fitness differences. Synthesis. Tree life history strategies describe the different ways trees grow, survive and recruit in the understorey. We show that the proportion of trees with a pioneer life history strategy increases steadily with tree size, as pioneers become relatively more abundant, productive, diverse and capture more resources towards the canopy. Fitness trade-offs associated with size and life history strategy offer a mechanism for coexistence in tropical forests.","","2024-03-05 19:43:21","2024-03-05 20:22:42","2024-03-05 19:43:20","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens often comprise a large portion of urban forests. Objectives We quantify structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston’s neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some birds and arboreal mammals. Methods The urban landscape was classified by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Results Back yard tree canopy cover was 65.23%. The majority of canopy links were on residential land (60.95% total), and particularly in backyards. Back yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65% total). Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at ~ 23% of total canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy. Conclusions The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities. Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and increased.","2019-12","2020-11-17 20:34:30","2023-12-07 17:42:09","","2935–2948","","12","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GZRE9FI6/Ossola et al. - 2019 - Yards increase forest connectivity in urban landscapes.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/BX3NC9EH/Ossola et al. - 2019 - Yards increase forest connectivity in urban landsc.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2019; F:Biodiversity; Year 7; T:Ecology; 2017PF-031; K:urban forestry; socio-ecological systems; K:urban forests; K:fragmentation; K:Landscape structure; K:urban habitat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contributions to a larger picture. To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic information about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many published papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses. We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolutionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible. These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:42:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","107 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CD84ZB7N/Gerstner et al. - 2017 - Will your paper be used in a meta-analysis Make t.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6ASZVT68/2041-210X.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Pursuit; T:Synthesis Research; Year 3; K:meta-analysis; 2013T7-015; K:open science; K:data reporting; K:reproducibility; K:transparency","","David Warton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior media coverage and research on these types of extremes have largely ignored winter weather events. However, rapid swings in winter weather can result in crossing from frozen to unfrozen conditions, or vice versa; thus, the potential impact of these types of events on coupled human and natural systems may be large. Given rapidly changing winter conditions in seasonally snow-covered regions, there is a pressing need for a deeper understanding of such events and the extent of their impacts to minimize their risks. Here we introduce the concept of winter weather whiplash, defined as a class of extreme event in which a collision of unexpected conditions produces a forceful, rapid, back-and-forth change in winter weather that induces an outsized impact on coupled human and natural systems. Using a series of case studies, we demonstrate that the effects of winter weather whiplash events depend on the natural and human context in which they occur, and discuss how these events may result in the restructuring of social and ecological systems. We use the long-term hydrometeorological record at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA to demonstrate quantitative methods for delineating winter weather whiplash events and their biophysical impacts. Ultimately, we argue that robust conceptual and quantitative frameworks for understanding winter weather whiplash events will contribute to the ways in which we mitigate and adapt to winter climate change in vulnerable regions.","2019-11","2020-11-17 20:30:05","2023-12-07 17:42:08","","2019EF001224","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","40 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/IMIENRE3/Casson et al. - 2019 - Winter Weather Whiplash Impacts of Meteorological.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4RZ7RA37/2019EF001224.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; reported to NSF; 2019; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Vulnerability & Risk; 2017C16-016; K:weather whiplash; K:extreme events; K:rain-on-snow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wildfire losses stem from the complex interplay of social and ecological forces at multiple scales, including global climate change, regional wildfire regimes altered by human activities, and locally managed wildland-urban interface (WUI) zones where homes increasingly encroach upon wildland vegetation. The coupled nature of the human-ecological system is precisely what makes reducing wildfire risks challenging. As losses from wildfire have accelerated, an emerging research and management objective has been to create fire-adapted communities where ecologically functional levels of wildfire are preserved but risks to human lives and property are minimized. Realizing such a vision will require widespread and decentralized action, but questions remain as to when and how such a transformation could take place. We suggest that the period following a destructive wildfire may provide a “hot moment” for community adaptation. Drawing from literature on natural hazard vulnerability, disaster recovery, and wildfire ecology, this paper proposes a linked social-ecological model of community recovery and adaptation after disaster. The model contends that changes during post-wildfire recovery shape a community's vulnerability to the next wildfire event. While other studies have highlighted linked social-ecological dynamics that influence pre-fire vulnerability, few studies have explored social-ecological feedbacks in post-fire recovery. This model contributes to interdisciplinary social science research on wildfires and to scholarship on community recovery by integrating hazard vulnerability reduction with recovery in a cyclical framework. Furthermore, it is adaptable to a variety of hazards beyond wildfire. The model provides a basis for future empirical work examining the nature and effectiveness of recovery efforts aimed at long-term vulnerability reduction.","2019-10","2020-11-17 20:30:08","2023-12-07 17:42:08","","101354","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RUKISD3H/Schumann et al. - 2019 - Wildfire recovery as a “hot moment” for creating fire-adapted communities(2).pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/W49K8SQR/S2212420919303346.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/NUIQ5MCP/Zotero Data Protocol 8.5.21.docx","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Pursuit; K:adaptation; T:Climate Change; reported to NSF; 2019; Year 7; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Vulnerability & Risk; K:modeling; K:socio-ecological model; 2017C16-022; K:Wildfire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first outline three key elements of the political economic context that create and enable land acquisition by drug traffickers. We then elucidate narcos' multiple motives for acquiring, transforming, and holding rural landed property. Ultimately, we make a case for understanding drug traffickers as a “narco-bourgeoisie” due to their use of cocaine profits to establish and extend private property relations into erstwhile communal and protected lands that were previously unavailable for capital accumulation.

There is no evidence that decoupling of the economy from GHG emissions is possible at the scale and speed needed. Second, investments in more sustainable infrastructure, including renewable energy, needed in coming decades will require extensive amounts of energy, largely from fossil sources, which will use up a significant share of the two-degree carbon budget. Third, improving the standard of living of the world’s poor will consume a major portion of the available carbon allowance. The scholarly community has a responsibility to put the issue of consumption and the associated production on the research and policy agenda.","2018-01","2020-11-17 20:34:43","2023-12-07 17:42:07","","1–5","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Taylor & Francis","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P2QNR2DE/Alfredsson et al. - 2018 - Why achieving the Paris Agreement requires reduced.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/6MSTAK6M/15487733.2018.html","","2018; F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; no acknowledgment; T:Climate Change; T:Natural Resource Management; Workshop; Year 6; K:energy policy; 2016W-064; K:consumption; K:greenhouse gas; K:Agenda 2030; K:economics; K:Paris Agreement; K:sustainable investments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extinction selectivity shows a statistically detectable and complex body mass effect, with survival probability decreasing for both mass extremes, indicating that intermediate-sized species have been more resilient. A strong interaction between mass and age of first human arrival provides quantitative evidence of larger mammals going extinct on the earliest islands colonized, revealing an extinction filter caused by past human activities. Survival probability increases on islands with lower mean elevation (mostly small cays acting as offshore refugia) and decreases with more frequent hurricanes, highlighting the risk of extreme weather events and rising sea levels to surviving species on low-lying cays. These findings demonstrate the interplay between intrinsic biology, regional ecology and specific local threats, providing insights for understanding drivers of biodiversity loss across island systems and fragmented habitats worldwide.","2021-03","2022-10-19 16:22:25","2023-12-07 17:42:06","2022-10-19 16:22:25","20202905","","1946","288","","","Where the wild things were","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","3 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Royal Society","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/A9JRFKDI/Turvey et al. - 2021 - Where the wild things were intrinsic and extrinsi.pdf","","Pursuit; F:Biodiversity; Year 8; T:Ecology; K:Caribbean; T:Environmental History; K:Holocene; K:extinction; 2018C18-007; K:West Indies; K:extinction risk; K:island extinctions; K:late Quaternary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence suggests that governance may play a critical role in influencing deforestation, and while a number of studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between national-level governance and deforestation, much remains to be known about the relative importance of subnational governance to deforestation outcomes. With a focus on the Brazilian Amazon, this study aims to understand the relationship between governance and deforestation at the municipal level. Drawing on the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as a guiding conceptual framework, and incorporating the additional dimension of environmental governance, we identified a wide array of publicly available data sources related to governance indicators that we used to select relevant governance variables. We compiled a dataset of 22 municipal-level governance variables covering the 2005–2018 period for 457 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Using an econometric approach, we tested the relationship between governance variables and deforestation rates in a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. We found that municipalities with increasing numbers of agricultural companies tended to have higher rates of deforestation, municipalities with an environmental fund tended to have lower rates of deforestation, and municipalities that had previously elected a female mayor tended to have lower rates of deforestation. These results add to the wider conversation on the role of local-level governance, revealing that certain governance variables may contribute to halting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.","2022-06","2022-07-14 18:21:16","2023-12-07 17:42:06","2022-07-14 18:21:16","e0269729","","6","17","","PLOS ONE","What’s governance got to do with it?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/76JGV588/Benzeev et al. - 2022 - What’s governance got to do with it Examining the.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VLVYD2U3/article.html","","T:Landscapes at Risk; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Natural Resource Management; Year 8; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; 2022; K:Brazil; K:Forests; K:Deforestation; 2018GS5-001; K:Conservation science; K:Environmental law; K:Governments; K:Law enforcement; K:Population density","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a first step, we have reviewed a random sample of environmental PM case study articles (n=60) using a novel PM process evaluation instrument. We found that significant work likely remains for PM to fully support participatory and integrated planning processes. While PM reports systematically address knowledge integration and learning, they often neglect the facilitation of a multi-value perspective within a democratic process, and the integration across organizations within a governance system.

Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of natural habitat to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control, whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While natural habitat has been shown to increase pest control in many systems, we here identify five hypotheses for when and why natural habitat can fail to support biological pest control, and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region, (2) natural habitat is a greater source of pests than natural enemies, (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does natural habitat, (4) natural habitat is insufficient in amount, proximity, composition, or configuration to provide large enough enemy populations needed for pest control, and (5) agricultural practices counteract enemy establishment and biocontrol provided by natural habitat. In conclusion, we show that the relative importance of natural habitat for biocontrol can vary dramatically depending on type of crop, pest, predator, land management, and landscape structure. This variation needs to be considered when designing measures aimed at enhancing biocontrol services through restoring or maintaining natural habitat.","2016-12","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:42:06","","","","","204","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","362 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] DOI: 10.1016/j.biocon.2016.10.001","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ANIZUZHW/S0006320716305249.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Agriculture; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; Venture; 2016; Year 3; T:Disease & Pests; F:Food Systems & the Environment; 2013V-021; K:Landscape structure; K:Natural enemies; K:Parasitoids; K:Spillover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most research on the exotic pet trade has focused on its contribution to native biodiversity loss and disease spread. Here, we synthesize information across taxa and research disciplines to document the exotic pet trade’s contribution to vertebrate biological invasions. We show recent and substantial worldwide growth in the number of non- native animal populations introduced via this invasion pathway, which demonstrates a strong potential to increase the number of invasive animals in the future. Key to addressing the invasion threat of exotic pets is learning more about the socioeconomic forces that drive the massive growth in the exotic pet market and the socio-ecological factors that underlie pet release by owners. These factors likely vary according to cultural pet- keeping traditions across regions and whether purchases were legal or illegal. These gaps in our understanding of the exotic pet trade must be addressed in order to implement effective policy solutions.","2019-06","2020-11-17 20:34:41","2023-12-07 17:42:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","139 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Economics; 2019; Year 6; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Risk; T:Disease & Pests; 2016C14-002; K:exotic pet trade; K:trade; K:pet trade; K:invasive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We predicted that urbanization would impact bacterial community composition, but that stream water column bacterial communities would be most strongly linked to urbanization at a watershed-scale, as measured by impervious cover, while sediment bacterial communities would correlate with environmental conditions at the scale of stream reaches. To test this hypothesis, we determined bacterial community composition in the water column and sediment of headwater streams located across a gradient of watershed impervious cover using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha diversity metrics did not show a strong response to catchment urbanization, but beta diversity was significantly related to watershed impervious cover with significant differences also found between water column and sediment samples. Samples grouped primarily according to habitat – water column versus sediment – with a significant response to watershed impervious cover nested within each habitat type. Compositional shifts for communities in urbanized streams indicated an increase in taxa associated with human activity including bacteria from the genus Polynucleobacter, which is widespread, but has been associated with eutrophic conditions in larger water bodies. Another indicator of communities in urbanized streams was an OTU from the genus Gallionella, which is linked to corrosion of water distribution systems. To identify changes in bacterial community interactions, bacterial co-occurrence networks were generated from urban and forested samples. The urbanized co-occurrence network was much smaller and had fewer co-occurrence events per taxon than forested equivalents, indicating a loss of keystone taxa with urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has significant impacts on the community composition of headwater streams, and suggest that processes driving these changes in urbanized water column versus sediment environments are distinct.","2017-08","2020-11-17 20:35:11","2023-12-07 17:42:05","","1452","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","88 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Frontiers","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Z4BW272P/Hosen et al. - 2017 - Watershed Urbanization Linked to Differences in St.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; F:Built Environment; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Ecology; K:community ecology; K:watershed; K:streams; K:bacteria; K:genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in developing countries, rural  and poor households often depend closely on natural capital for their livelihoods and health. However,  the  health consequences of ecosystem declines remain difficult to predict. Here, we report on two multicountry analysis to investigate general relationships between ecosystems and human health for these vulnerable populations.  Methods  We compiled a unique dataset covering about 300 000 children from more than 35 countries, by combining Demographic  and  Health  Surveys  (DHS) with additional information about   socioeconomic, climate, and environmental factors. We first examined the relationship between watershed conditions and diarrhoeal disease, a major cause of child malnutrition and mortality worldwide. In a second analysis, we then related forest cover more broadly to three health outcomes: diarrhoea, stunting, and anaemia. For both analyses, we used nested mixed-effects logit models to predict the probability of disease based on environmental variables as well as covariates representing climate, sanitation, education, and wealth. Findings In the first analysis, we find that more  human activity upstream increases the  probability of reported diarrhoea (model coefficient 0·10 [standard error (SE) 0·02]), and that higher tree cover upstream reduces it (–0·13 [0·04]). These effects are statistically significant for rural households (human activity: 0·11 [SE 0·03]; tree cover: –0·17 [0·05]),  but  not  urban  households  (human  activity:  0·07  [SE  0·04];  tree  cover:  –0·07  [0·06]),  suggesting  shifting  dependences  from  natural  to  built  capital. In the second analysis, we find  that increased forest cover reduced the  probabilities of all three diseases for the poorest segment of the population, but not for the wealthiest, again indicating differential dependencies on nature.  Interpretation   These analyses provide evidence that intact ecosystems are associated with improved child health outcomes, especially for the most vulnerable populations. Under certain conditions, therefore, efforts to protect and restore ecosystems could be considered an important public health investment.

International trade can increase or decrease inequality in food availability, but little is known about how specific countries and commodities contribute to this redistribution. We present a method based on the Gini coefficient for evaluating the contributions of country and commodity specific trade to inequality in the global food system. We applied the method to global food production and trade data for the years 1986–2011 to identify the specific countries and commodities that contribute to increasing and decreasing inequality in global food availability relative to food production. Overall, international trade reduced inequality in food availability by 25%–33% relative to the distribution of food production, depending on the year. Across all years, about 58% of the total trade links acted to reduce inequality with ∼4% of the links providing 95% of the reduction in inequality. Exports from United States of America, Malaysia, Argentina, and Canada are particularly important in decreasing inequality. Specific commodities that reduce inequality when traded include cereals and vegetables. Some trade connections contribute to increasing inequality, but this effect is mostly concentrated within a small number of commodities including fruits, stimulants, and nuts. In terms of specific countries, exports from Slovenia, Oman, Singapore, and Germany act to increase overall inequality. Collectively, our analysis and results represent an opportunity for building an enhanced understanding of global-scale patterns in food availability.","2016-09","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:42:05","","095013","","9","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Agriculture; 2016; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; Fellow; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:trade; K:inequality; K:commodities; K:exports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to assess the views of urban forest actors in LAC cities on how they participate in collective decision-making, the current state of urban forest management and governance, and contact among actors, with a focus on how these views related to each other and differences among government and non-government actors. We designed and delivered an online survey to government and non-government actors in ten LAC capital cities, including Bogotá, Brasília, Buenos Aires, Ciudad de México, Ciudad de Panamá, La Paz, Lima, San José , San Juan, and Santiago de Chile. We analysed 155 responses using regression-based techniques. We found that more contact among actors resulted in more participation in collective decision making and more optimistic views about the state of urban forest management and governance. Also, more optimistic views about the state of urban forest management and governance resulted in more trust in local governments. Non-government actors had lower levels of trust in local governments than government actors. We discuss how implementing urban forest policies does not solely depend on having enough resources (e.g., finances, personnel) but also on engaging in collective decision-making and improving trust in the institutions in charge of implementing urban forest policies.","2023-03","2023-03-28 14:14:32","2023-12-07 17:42:04","2023-03-28 14:14:32","106635","","","129","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","2 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8CARB4NZ/Ordóñez Barona et al. - 2023 - Views of government and non-government actors on u.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/2795BW3D/S0264837723001011.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; T:Social Science; T:Sociology; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Natural Resource Management; Workshop; T:Ecology; T:Policy & Regulation; Year 9; T:Governance & Decision Making; F:Case study collection; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2023; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Nature-based solutions; 2019W-087; K:Urban planning; K:Green infrastructure; K:Local government; K:Non-government; K:Urban ecosystems; K:Urban greening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It typically entails the use of fertilizers, new cultivars, irrigation, and other modern technology. In regions of the world affected by seasonal or chronic water scarcity, yield gap closure is strongly dependent on irrigation (blue water). Global yield gap assessments have often ignored whether the water required to close the yield gap is locally available. Here we perform a gridded global analysis (10km resolution) of the blue water consumption that is needed annually to close the yield gap worldwide and evaluate the associated pressure on renewable freshwater resources. We find that, to close the yield gap, human appropriation of freshwater resources for irrigation would have to increase at least by 146%. Most study countries would experience at least a doubling in blue water requirement, with 71% of the additional blue water being required by only four crops – maize, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Further, in some countries (e.g., Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen) the total volume of blue water required for yield gap closure would exceed sustainable levels of freshwater consumption (i.e., 40% of total renewable surface and groundwater resources).","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:42:04","","67–75","","","99","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7C73U8D9/Davis et al. - 2017 - Water limits to closing yield gaps.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/QNK5ZU7A/S0309170816302044.html","","2017; no acknowledgment; T:Agriculture; F:Water & People; T:Vulnerability; Fellow; F:Food Systems & the Environment; T:Food Systems; K:consumption; K:Freshwater resources; K:Irrigation; K:Water scarcity; K:Yield gap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, urban ecology and remote sensing have largely focused on cities in temperate zones. Our goal was to characterize urban vegetation cover with sub-meter (<1 m) resolution aerial imagery, and identify social-ecological relationships of urban vegetation patterns in a tropical city, the San Juan Metropolitan Area, Puerto Rico. Our specific objectives were to (1) map vegetation cover using sub-meter spatial resolution (0.3-m) imagery, (2) quantify the amount of residential and non-residential vegetation, and (3) investigate the relationship between patterns of urban vegetation vs. socioeconomic and environmental factors. We found that 61% of the San Juan Metropolitan Area was green and that our combination of high spatial resolution imagery and object-based classification was highly successful for extracting vegetation cover in a moist tropical city (97% accuracy). In addition, simple spatial pattern analysis allowed us to separate residential from non-residential vegetation with 76% accuracy, and patterns of residential and non-residential vegetation varied greatly across the city. Both socioeconomic (e.g., population density, building age, detached homes) and environmental variables (e.g., topography) were important in explaining variations in vegetation cover in our spatial regression models. However, important socioeconomic drivers found in cities in temperate zones, such as income and home value, were not important in San Juan. Climatic and cultural differences between tropical and temperate cities may result in different social-ecological relationships. Our study provides novel information for local land use planners, highlights the value of high spatial resolution remote sensing data to advance ecological research and urban planning in tropical cities, and emphasizes the need for more studies in tropical cities.","2018-02","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:42:04","","681-693","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] PMID: 29284190","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Economics; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; Year 7; T:Ecology; T:Earth Science/Physical Geography; 2017PF-031; K:remote sensing; K:airborne imagery; K:object-based classification; K:Puerto Rico; K:residential vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose the use of leading indicators, which denote likelihood of a certain outcome (e.g., odds that seedlings are of quality and properly planted) to complement lagging indicators and describe how this construct differs from the current practice and how they can be used in conjunction with available frameworks for forest restoration. Leading indicators have great promise to complement lagging indicators because they address the near-term factors more likely to influence the progress and performance of restoration efforts. For example, secure land tenure (leading indicator) can increase the likelihood of long-term maintenance and protection (lagging indicator), and the use of best practices in quality seedling production (leading indicator) can increase survival rate (lagging indicator). By observing near-term leading indicators, management can be adapted towards a goal. Long-term impacts cannot be verified in the early stages of forest restoration, hence claiming success within the length of project cycles is often unrealistic. Reporting on leading indicators can inform the likelihood that forest restoration goals will be achieved in the longer term. Synthesis and applications. Leading indicators complement lagging indicators and can be used in forest restoration beyond monitoring and evaluation. Indicators can also be used in the design, adaptive management and reporting of restoration interventions. Leading indicators can be used to identify issues that might prevent success in a timely manner so they can be addressed.","2021-06","2021-10-04 13:32:14","2023-12-07 17:42:03","2021-10-04 13:32:14","1806-1812","","9","58","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","9 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13938","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/X3G2T7DB/Ota et al. - 2021 - Using leading and lagging indicators for forest re.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FHESVA5K/1365-2664.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; F:Land & Human Dynamics; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 5; T:Natural Resource Management; 2021; K:adaptive management; K:indicators; 2015C12-015; K:reforestation; K:restoration; K:monitoring and evaluation; K:Bonn Challenge; K:forest landscape restoration (FLR); K:UN Decade in Ecosystem Restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the case for rabies, a viral disease of mammals. While Carnivora (carnivores) and Chiroptera (bats) are the canonical mammalian orders known to be responsible for the maintenance and onward transmission of rabies Lyssavirus (RABV), the role of most species within these orders remains unknown and is continually changing as a result of contemporary host shifting. We combined a trait-based analytical approach with gradient boosting machine learning models to identify physiological and ecological host features associated with being a reservoir for RABV. We then used a cooperative game theory approach to determine species-specific traits associated with known RABV reservoirs. Being a carnivore reservoir for RABV was associated with phylogenetic similarity to known RABV reservoirs, along with other traits such as having larger litters and earlier sexual maturity. For bats, location in the Americas and geographic range were the most important predictors of RABV reservoir status, along with having a large litter. Our models identified 44 carnivore and 34 bat species that are currently not recognized as RABV reservoirs, but that have trait profiles suggesting their capacity to be or become reservoirs. Further, our findings suggest that potential reservoir species among bats and carnivores occur both within and outside of areas with current RABV circulation. These results show the ability of a trait-based approach to detect potential reservoirs of infection and could inform rabies control programs and surveillance efforts by identifying the types of species and traits that facilitate RABV maintenance and transmission.","2020-12","2021-05-28 21:27:57","2023-12-07 17:42:03","2021-05-28 21:27:57","","","12","14","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","26 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/UIAECIIP/Worsley-Tonks et al. - 2020 - Using host traits to predict reservoir host specie.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GDN8M3PE/article.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 8; 2020; T:Ecology; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; F:Vulnerability & Risk; T:Disease & Pests; 2018PF-040; K:Wildlife; T:Wildlife; K:Bats; K:Carnivory; K:Phylogenetics; K:Rabies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public interest and support are required to maximize the effectiveness of policies to combat the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks of zoonoses. Here, we use internet search data from the United States to investigate changes in public information seeking about topics at the intersection of health and the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using breakpoint detection methods, we identify sharp increases in interest for ‘wildlife trade’, ‘bats’, and ‘pangolins’ in the early stages of the pandemic (on Jan. 12, Jan. 19, and Jan. 26, 2020, respectively). Network analyses also revealed increasing connectivity between terms related to human health and the environment, as well as the emergence of novel search terms pointing to a greater interest in wildlife trade and consumption. During the pandemic, the network connectivity between coronavirus keywords and conservation keywords increased, which we measured using the number of unique connections (edge connectivity, k′ (G)) and the number of simple paths (Sp) between keywords. Both measures of network connectivity increased between ‘coronavirus’ and ‘bats’ or ‘pangolins’ (Δk′ (G) = 1, ΔSp = 37), and between ‘coronavirus’ and ‘conservation’ (Δk′ (G) = 1, ΔSp = 160). These findings suggest that policy and outreach efforts aimed at engaging public interest in intersectional approaches to pandemic prevention (eg: One Health, Planetary Health), may be able to take advantage of increases in public information seeking following catalyzing events during the pandemic. Further monitoring is needed to determine if these changes persist over time.","2021-05","2021-04-09 17:42:53","2023-12-07 17:42:03","2021-04-09 17:42:47","109078","","","257","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/K7BAIHVW/Vijay et al. - 2021 - Using internet search data to understand informati.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/37H25LS4/S0006320721001300.html","","sesync acknowledgment; 2018PF-038; Postdoc; reported to NSF; Year 8 (FG); 2018PF-043; T:Conservation; T:Methods & Methodology; 2021; K:trade; K:networks; 2017PF-036; K:Planetary health; Year 8 (VV); 2018PF-039; K:Google Trends; K:information seeking; K:One Health; K:Pandemic; Year 7 (CF); Year 8 (KJ)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurements of stable isotopes in water have facilitated estimates of the depth distribution of RWU for various tree species through methodologies based on end member mixing analysis (EMMA). EMMA often assumes that the isotopic composition of tree-stored xylem water (δXYLEM) is representative of the isotopic composition of RWU (δRWU). We tested this assumption within the framework of EcH2O-iso, a process-based distributed tracer-aided ecohydrologic model, applied to a small temperate catchment with a vegetation cover of coniferous eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and deciduous American beech (Fagus grandifolia). We simulated three scenarios for tree water storage and mixing: (a) zero storage (ZS), (b) storage with a well-mixed reservoir (WM), and (c) storage with piston flow (PF). Simulating tree storage (WM and PF) improved the fit to δXYLEM observations over ZS in the summer and fall seasons and substantially altered calibrated RWU depths and stomatal conductance. Our results suggest that there are likely to be advantages to considering tree storage and internal mixing when attempting to interpret δXYLEM in the estimation of RWU depths and critical zone water residence times, particularly during periods of low transpiration. Improved representations of tree water dynamics could yield more accurate ecohydrologic and earth system model representations of the critical zone.","2020-02","2020-11-17 20:30:04","2023-12-07 17:42:03","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/LT2ZNG8U/Knighton et al. - 2020 - Using isotopes to incorporate tree water storage a.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; 2020; F:Water & People; 2019PF-048; Year 9; K:modeling; K:hydrology; K:plant; K:EcH2O-iso; K:isotopes; K:roots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we overcome this limitation by using geotagged social media data to assess patterns of visitation to urban and peri-urban green space across park systems in the metropolitan area of the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. We find that parks with nearby water features, more amenities, greater accessibility from the presence of trails, and that are located within neighborhoods with higher population density, are associated with higher rates of visitation. As cities grow and shifts in demographics occur, more responsive management of public green space will become increasingly important to ensure urban parks provide ecosystem services and meet users' needs. Using social media data to rapidly assess park use at a lower cost than traditional surveys has the potential to inform public green space management with targeted information on user behavior and values of urban residents.","2018-07","2020-11-17 20:35:06","2023-12-07 17:42:03","","1–10","","","175","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","166 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/3GHZG3RJ/Donahue et al. - 2018 - Using social media to understand drivers of urban .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/P5LLS5BD/S0169204618300550.html","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; Year 4; F:Built Environment; Pursuit; T:Social Science; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2014T10-020; K:recreation; K:social media; K:green spaces; K:cultural; K:parks; K:preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, we define the concept in a way that is consistent with this epistemology, building on previous work on speed, scale, stickiness, and interrelationships, but also emphasising human perceptions and rhetorical uses of the notion. Third, we propose a novel typology of the ways in which the regime shift concept is used in analysing social–environmental phenomena in geography and beyond. These uses are categorised along two axes. On the one side, we distinguish between description of past or present changes and normative prescriptions for the future. On the other side, we distinguish between whether the focus is on material shifts (social and ecological) or conceptual shifts (discourses and ideas). We illustrate the typology with reference to social–environmental changes in landscapes around the world that are dominated by plantations or the widespread naturalisation of Australian Acacia species. We conclude that the regime shift concept is a boundary object with value as both an analytical and communicative tool in addressing social–environmental challenges.","2017-11","2020-11-17 20:35:09","2023-12-07 17:42:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/R3QAEKNJ/Kull et al. - 2018 - Using the “regime shift” concept in addressing soc.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/Q5YJMH3C/1745-5871.html","","F:Socio-Environmental Resilience; sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; 2017; Pursuit; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; Year 3; K:Biological invasions; K:epistemology; 2013T7-006; K:boundary object; K:regime; K:systems theory; K:tipping point","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighty percent of Mongolia's land area is rangeland, where interacting climate, land-use and changes in governance threaten the sustainability of Mongolia's rangelands and pastoral culture. Particularly concerning are the potential ecological impacts of changing pastoral grazing practices—namely declining use of grazing reserves and pastoral mobility. However, like other grazing practices globally, there have been no empirical studies to evaluate the effects of specific Mongolian grazing practices on ecological function at a management scale. We collected data on the grazing practices of 130 pastoral households across four ecological zones and sampled ecological conditions in their winter pastures. We used a novel social-ecological analysis process to (1) develop integrated, holistic indicators of ecological function using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and (2) assess the effects of individual grazing practices on these indicators using statistical matching to control for confounding management and contextual factors. We identified two latent factors related to ecological and pastoral resilience: Factor 1 represents resource retention and soil stability and Factor 2 represents species richness and functional diversity. Using these two factors as response variables, we found that the values of both resilience factors were higher in pastures where households made fall or winter otor migrations or set aside grazing reserves. This study provides the first management-scale empirical test of the ecological response to specific grazing practices in Mongolia, using an approach that can be applied in other rangeland systems. Our findings highlight the importance to ecological and pastoral resilience of supporting traditional pastoral practices of mobility and grazing reserves, while also controlling stocking densities, increasing rangeland monitoring, and ensuring equitable access to state-designated emergency grazing reserves at local, regional, and national levels.","2018-07","2020-11-17 20:35:05","2023-12-07 17:42:02","","075010","","7","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: IOP Publishing","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Landscapes at Risk; T:Resilience; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Agriculture; Year 6; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:migration; 2016PF-022; K:pastoral; K:Livestock; K:practices; K:rangeland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Green space also promotes physical activity, psychological well-being, and the general public health of urban residents. This paper reviews the Anglo-American literature on urban green space, especially parks, and compares efforts to green US and Chinese cities. Most studies reveal that the distribution of such space often disproportionately benefits predominantly White and more affluent communities. Access to green space is therefore increasingly recognized as an environmental justice issue. Many US cities have implemented strategies to increase the supply of urban green space, especially in park-poor neighborhoods. Strategies include greening of remnant urban land and reuse of obsolete or underutilized transportation infrastructure. Similar strategies are being employed in Chinese cities where there is more state control of land supply but similar market incentives for urban greening. In both contexts, however, urban green space strategies may be paradoxical: while the creation of new green space to address environmental justice problems can make neighborhoods healthier and more esthetically attractive, it also can increase housing costs and property values. Ultimately, this can lead to gentrification and a displacement of the very residents the green space strategies were designed to benefit. Urban planners, designers, and ecologists, therefore, need to focus on urban green space strategies that are ‘just green enough' and that explicitly protect social as well as ecological sustainability.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:30","2023-12-07 17:42:01","","234–244","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2210 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/E7PTETRZ/Wolch et al. - 2014 - Urban green space, public health, and environmenta.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/PITCUWSI/S0169204614000310.html","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; 2014; 2012T1-009; K:green spaces; K:Gentrification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Former uses of these properties range from heavy industry to residential neighborhoods, and each bears many potential legacies of past uses, including: introduction of contaminants that may threaten the health of humans and other species, engineering of land and infrastructure that may undermine hydrological ecosystem services, and introduction of species including invasives. While the ecological functions that characterize vacant urban lands have been only partially investigated, the legacies associated with their past uses are known to affect ecosystem services. In addition, changed industries, weakened economies, arcane financial systems, population migration, and aging resident populations have left many people living in the midst of this vacancy, with clear implications for human health and safety. Since market demand is weak in highly vacant districts, social capital may be particularly important to protecting quality of life and ecosystem services. New design and planning approaches should be informed by urban ecological knowledge that is synthesized with social and cultural understanding of residents' perceptions and values. Interest in urban agriculture, green infrastructure, and open space planning for vacant urban lands is burgeoning. However, without adequate knowledge of highly vacant districts as socio-ecological systems, design and planning may have unintended consequences for human health, water quality, adaptation to climate change, and a panoply of other ecosystem services.

The sustainability and resilience of rangelands in this region depend on the ability of residents and policy makers to quickly respond by adapting livelihoods and land uses to changes in environmental and socio-economic conditions, but the responses of the system to these changes are often non-linear and difficult to predict. We developed a system dynamics model to understand how the human, natural, and land-use processes in the Mongolian rangeland ecosystem interact to produce dynamic outcomes in both grassland productivity and livestock populations. We developed two separate models based on a common integrative framework for two case study areas: Suhkbaatar Aimag in Mongolia and Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia. We used future scenarios for each region generated with stakeholder input to forecast trends in grassland area, livestock numbers, and biomass under alternative climate, socioeconomic, and land-use futures. By incorporating stakeholder-developed scenarios, we were able to explore future scenarios tailored to the particular questions and concerns relevant to the individual study areas. We find that while there are many similarities in the factors driving system dynamics in the two countries, the trajectories of key grassland resources are quite different, both between the two study regions and across the individual scenarios. Environmental policies play a key role in Xilingol, while economic development is a key driver in Sukhbaatar. Urbanization dynamics will be a major influence on the availability of grassland resources in the future.","2017-02","2020-11-17 20:35:20","2023-12-07 17:42:01","","35–46","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/7SN8LQJL/Allington et al. - 2017 - Urbanization and environmental policy effects on t.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/4NWF9UAF/S1462901116303100.html","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Resilience; 2017; T:Climate Change; T:Sustainability; F:Land & Human Dynamics; Postdoc; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; T:Methods & Methodology; Year 6; 2016PF-022; K:Livestock; K:Desertification; K:System dynamics model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The direct manipulation of plants affects the benefits people receive from plants. In synthesizing several studies of urban biodiversity in Los Angeles, we find that cultivated plants differ from those in remnant natural areas. This highlights the importance of studying cultivated plants in cities, which is crucial for the design and planning of sustainable cities. Residents have created a new urban biome in Los Angeles, and this has consequences for associated organisms, ultimately resulting in a responsibility for society to determine what type of biome we wish to create. Summary Urbanization is a large driver of biodiversity globally. Within cities, urban trees, gardens, and residential yards contribute extensively to plant biodiversity, although the consequences and mechanisms of plant cultivation for biodiversity are uncertain. We used Los Angeles, California, USA as a case study for investigating plant diversity in cultivated areas. We synthesized datasets quantifying the diversity of urban trees, residential yards, and community gardens in Los Angeles, the availability of plants from nurseries, and residents’ attitudes about plant attributes. Cultivated plant diversity was drastically different from remnant natural areas; compared to remnant natural areas, cultivated areas contained more exotic species, more than double the number of plant species, and turnover in plant functional trait distributions. In cultivated areas, most plants were intentionally planted and dominated by exotic species planted for ornamental purposes. Most tree species sampled in Los Angeles were available for sale in local nurseries. Residents’ preferences for specific plant traits were correlated with the trait composition of the plant community, suggesting cultivated plant communities at least partially reflect resident preferences. Our findings demonstrate the importance of cultivated species in a diverse megacity that are driven in part through commercial distribution. The cultivation of plants in Los Angeles greatly increases regional plant biodiversity through changes in species composition and functional trait distributions. The pervasive presence of cultivated species likely has many consequences for residents and the ecosystem services they receive compared with unmanaged or remnant urban areas.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:34:32","2023-12-07 17:42:01","","144-156","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XY8WZC5J/Avolio et al. - 2020 - Urban plant diversity in Los Angeles, California .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/VC5B9YWL/ppp3.html","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Postdoc; Year 5; C:Case Study; 2019; F:Biodiversity; F:Ecosystem Services; T:Ecology; K:trees; 2015PF-018; K:residential yards; K:gardens; K:plant species; K:remnant natural areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Watershed managers in urban regions often implement infiltration-based stormwater control measures (SCMs) to mitigate the effects of urbanization. Most research on SCM implementation, however, has focused primarily on their effects of sediment and nutrient loading, so little is known about the effect of SCMs on other urban stressors to which aquatic ecosystems are especially sensitive (e.g., flow patterns, temperature, conductivity). We addressed this research gap by studying the hydro-ecological effects of SCM implementation in 11 headwater streams in Maryland, USA. The study included 4 forested streams, 4 urban streams (urban-degraded), and 3 urban streams whose watersheds contain regenerative stormwater conveyances (urban-restored), a type of infiltration-based SCM. We measured baseflow discharge and water quality monthly and monitored stream stage, temperature, and precipitation at high frequencies over a 1-y period. We also quantified aquatic insect assemblage composition during the spring season of the monitoring year. We found that stream conductivity and daily maximum water temperatures increased with increasing impervious cover and that SCM implementation had no effect on these metrics. Dissolved oxygen was lower in the urban-restored streams than in forested streams, whereas dissolved oxygen was slightly higher in urban-degraded streams than in urban-restored streams. Temperature surges during runoff events were highest in the urban-degraded streams and lower in urban-restored streams, indicating mitigation by SCM implementation. All metrics describing aquatic insect abundance and diversity metrics were negatively affected by urbanization, and SCM implementation had no effect on most of these metrics. Multivariate analyses revealed multiple stressors present in the urban streams, but conductivity explained most of the variance in insect assemblage composition across the study sites. Conductivity was strongly correlated with chloride concentrations, suggesting road salt is a source of elevated conductivity. Chloride concentrations exceeded established chronic and acute criteria in several urban streams, including 2 of the 3 urban-restored streams. These results document that the effects of urbanization in streams persist even after SCM implementation occurs. Ultimately, our research underscores the need for restoration designs to address multiple stressors that cause ecosystem degradation in urbanized streams.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:30:08","2023-12-07 17:42:01","","000–000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: University of Chicago Press","","","","sesync acknowledgment; Staff; F:Built Environment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; 2019; K:biodiversity; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; T:Pollution; K:stormwater management; wrong DBI; K:watershed; K:water quality; K:restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a long period of stagnation during recent centuries, urbanization has revived again in China since the economic reform in 1978. Strongly influenced by national land use policy and the history of urbanization after 1949, China's urban ecology has gone through three development periods: the emergent period (1983–1989), the early growth period (1990–1999), and the rapid development period (2000–present). In this paper, we first provide a historical review of urbanization and urban ecology in China; based on this retrospective analysis, we further identify the main characteristics of, and missing links in, China's urban ecological research; and finally we suggest future research directions. The amount and scope of research in urban ecology and environment conducted in China since the 1980s are impressive. Not only did Chinese scholars import Western ideas to develop urban ecological science, but also they have promoted a holistic, use-inspired, transdisciplinary philosophy for studying and managing urban systems – which has unique Chinese characteristics. After more than 5000 years of being predominantly agrarian, China is now urban, and will become only more urban in the future. This continued fast urbanization makes China a living laboratory for studying urbanization, and China's urban ecology seems poised to make strides in the coming decades.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:29","2023-12-07 17:42:00","","222–233","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/CU8KPH2P/Jianguo Wu et al. - 2014 - Urban ecology in China Historical developments an.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/FGQ67T9B/S0169204614000450.html","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; T:Ecology; 2014; 2012T1-009; K:Urbanization; T:Environmental History; K:Sustainability; K:China; K:Ecology of cities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cities have been the engines of socioeconomic development but also the centers of major environmental problems since the industrial revolution. Numerous studies have shown that our urban ecosystems and landscapes are on an unsustainable trajectory. Global sustainability depends critically on cities, and urban ecology can – and needs to – play a key role in the transition toward sustainability. In this paper, I review different definitions and perspectives of urban ecology, discuss major advances and key issues, and propose a framework to help move the field forward. After almost 90 years of development, urban ecology has evolved into a truly transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates ecological, geographical, planning, and social sciences. The most salient thrust of current research activities in the field is the emerging urban sustainability paradigm which focuses on urban ecosystem services and their relations to human well-being. While urbanization is complex in many ways, we do know a lot about its patterns, processes, and effects. More specifically, we know a great deal about urban growth patterns in space and time, the underlying drivers and mechanisms, and myriad effects of urbanization on biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem services. Compared to their ancient counterparts, contemporary cities tend to be bigger in physical size and ecological footprint, faster in growth rate in terms of both population and urbanized land, and more irregular in landscape composition and configuration. As coevolving human-environment systems, cities are spatially heterogeneous, complex adaptive systems. As such, the dynamic trajectory of cities can never be fully predicted or controlled, but can and should be influenced or guided in more desirable directions through planning and design activities that are based on urban ecological knowledge and sustainability principles.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:30","2023-12-07 17:42:00","","209–221","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","696 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; Year 1; T:Sustainability; T:Ecology; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; 2014; T:Human Health & Well-Being; 2012T1-009; K:Biodiversity; K:Urban growth patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, the almost complete clearing of the original tropical lowland forests and the ensuing catastrophic extinction of the original biodiversity, suggest how cities ought to avoid the same developmental pathway. On the other hand, the relatively high percentage of vegetation cover that the city has achieved due to effective urban greening policies suggest that opportunities still exist to restore functions associated with a healthy urban ecosystem. This paper reviewed urban ecological research on Singapore conducted between 1991 and 2012, and summarized the key findings according to the state factors of an urban ecosystem. The review showed that the large majority of the studies were focused on biodiversity, and were on the ecology in a city. It revealed gaps in urban ecological knowledge of Singapore, especially in relation to how studies on the ecology of the city need to link urban ecological research to issues of urban sustainability. Three key strategies are suggested to advance knowledge in this area. These are, to focus on long-term ecological studies in Singapore as an example of a high-density equatorial urban ecosystem, to consciously treat the built component of the urban environment as a key component of urban ecological studies, and to leverage the strong interests in eco-city development as field experimental sites for urban ecological studies.","2014-05","2020-11-17 20:35:30","2023-12-07 17:42:00","","271–289","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","45 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/XGPDXM8Y/Tan and Abdul Hamid - 2014 - Urban ecological research in Singapore and its rel.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/ISR7NW7S/S0169204614000334.html","","T:Resilience; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; Year 1; T:Sustainability; T:Ecology; 2014; 2012T1-009; K:ecology in a city; K:Livability; K:Singapore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings show how the production of commodities for U.S. consumption tends to reify inequalities between countries. Larger shares of value added (in comparison to shares of carbon emissions) are generally experienced by more-developed, more-integrated countries, whereas the opposite tendency is experienced in less-developed, less-integrated regions.

To do so, we use a long-term phenological data set of 20 common butterfly species from 83 sites across the state of Ohio, USA, with sites that range from rural undeveloped areas to moderately sized cities. These sites span a latitudinal gradient in mean temperature of several °C, mimicking the range of projected global climate warming effects through the end of the century. Although shifts toward earlier phenology are typical of species' responses to either global climate change or urbanization, we found that their interaction delayed several Ohio butterfly species' first appearance and peak abundance phenology. Exploitative species exhibited smaller delays in first appearance and peak abundance phenology in areas that were urbanized and geographically warm. Our results show that phenological responses to urbanization are contingent upon geographic variation in temperature, and that the impacts of urbanization and global climate change should be considered simultaneously when developing forecasts of biological responses to environmental change.","2014-09","2020-11-17 20:35:23","2023-12-07 17:41:59","","2613–2621","","9","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","64 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RGR966JD/Diamond et al. - 2014 - Unexpected phenological responses of butterflies t.pdf","","sesync acknowledgment; F:Built Environment; Year 1; Workshop; T:Ecology; F:Computationally Intensive Projects & Initiatives; 2014; 2012W-002; K:temperature; K:citizen science; K:phenology; K:traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Synthesis is promoted as an approach that deals with the challenge of öinformation overload', delivering products that further our understanding of problems and distil relevant evidence for decision-making. However, despite the increasing prominence of synthesis efforts in the science and policy landscape, we know very little about the impacts these initiatives have on research, policy and practice and the assumptions underpinning how they will lead to change. This paper presents a framework for considering the conceptual, strategic, instrumental and network-based impacts of research synthesis on policy. This framework provides insight into the range of underlying assumptions and impacts on policy and practice from 10 case studies of research synthesis related to contemporary sustainability challenges. Findings suggest that research synthesis is having diverse impacts on research, policy and practice including creating a new understanding of problems, establishing new networks, and contributing to changes in policy and practice. These impacts emerged across a range of contexts, synthesis methods, assumptions and operating models. This suggests that there is no single öcorrect way' to design research synthesis for impact, but rather a need to tailor the approach for the context of intended use.","2018-08","2020-11-17 20:30:31","2023-12-07 17:41:59","","72–84","","","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","38 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/9LXS5IBB/Wyborn et al. - 2018 - Understanding the Impacts of Research Synthesis.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KX9Z5BDD/S1462901117311048.html","","2018; Staff; no acknowledgment; reported to NSF; T:Synthesis Research; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Actionable Research; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:Science policy interface; K:science-policy interface; K:Credibility; K:Research impact; K:Salience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, small-scale fisheries (SFF) often lack formal institutions, leaving management in the hands of local users in the form of various governance approaches (e.g., local, traditional, or co-management). The effectiveness of these approaches inherently relies upon some level of cohesion among resource users to facilitate agreement on common policies and practices regarding common pool fishery resources. Understanding the factors driving the formation and maintenance of community cohesion in SSF is therefore critical if we are to devise more effective participatory governance approaches and encourage and empower decentralized, localized, and community-based resource management approaches. Here, we adopt a social relational network perspective to propose a suite of hypothesized drivers that lead to the establishment of social ties among fishers that build the foundation for community cohesion. We then draw on detailed data from Jamaica's small-scale fishery to empirically test these drivers by employing a set of nested exponential random graph models (ERGMs) based on specific structural building blocks (i.e., network configurations) theorized to influence the establishment of social ties. Our results demonstrate that multiple drivers are at play, but that collectively, gear-based homophily, geographic proximity, and leadership play particularly important roles. We discuss the extent to which these drivers help explain previous experiences, as well as their implications for future and sustained collective action in SSF in Jamaica and elsewhere.","2018-03","2020-11-17 20:35:07","2023-12-07 17:41:59","","519–547","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","2018; sesync acknowledgment; T:Social Science; Postdoc; reported to NSF; T:Natural Resource Management; F:Socio-Environmental Modeling; Year 6; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Fisheries; F:Qualitative & Mixed Methods Data Analysis; 2016PF-023; K:networks; K:Network analysis; K:Community-based conservation; K:Cohesion; K:common pool","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forests and wetlands can provide ecosystem services that help maintain water quality. To understand the connections between land cover and childhood DD, we compiled a database of 293,362 children in 35 countries with information on health, socioeconomic factors, climate, and watershed condition. Using hierarchical models, here we find that higher upstream tree cover is associated with lower probability of DD downstream. This effect is significant for rural households but not for urban households, suggesting differing dependence on watershed conditions. In rural areas, the effect of a 30% increase in upstream tree cover is similar to the effect of improved sanitation, but smaller than the effect of improved water source, wealth or education. We conclude that maintaining natural capital within watersheds can be an important public health investment, especially for populations with low levels of built capital. Globally diarrheal disease through contaminated water sources is a major cause of child mortality.

Despite modeling that suggests the efficacy of best management practices in agricultural systems to be sufficient to address the problem, adoption by farmers remains far below the levels needed to achieve significant water quality improvements and new approaches to encourage and sustain adoption are urgently needed. In this work, we apply a modified transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavior change to a longitudinal dataset (N = 584) of farmers’ adoption decisions and stated intentions to use cover crops, collected in the Maumee Basin of Lake Erie, USA in 2016 and 2018. The TTM posits that behavior changes over time and is influenced by different social-psychological processes at each stage of change. Our findings confirm past research into the importance of many of the factors investigated, while providing new insight into their role in specific stages of the change process with potential implications for the design of interventions for farmers in different stages. Several factors investigated (mean environmental concern, education, information from conservation groups and off-farm income) were uniquely important to a particular stage. Other factors (response efficacy at the field level, total farm size and risks of spring planting interference) were important at both an earlier and later stage, but less important in predicting middle stages of change. A third set of factors (self-efficacy, proportion rented, no-till adoption and uncertain long-term paybacks) were statistically important across each stage of the TTM model. In applying the TTM longitudinally, we found evidence that farmers in a more advanced stage of cover crop adoption, in the first wave of data collection (2016) were more likely to have adopted cover crops in the second wave (2018), a result not predicted by individual factors alone. We report findings for cover crops but see the potential for the transtheoretical model of behavior change to be applied to other best management practice adoption decisions and to diverse populations of farmers to generate similarly novel insight and utility for intervention design and targeting.","2022-09","2022-09-22 19:16:07","2023-12-07 17:41:58","2022-09-22 19:16:07","116136","","","323","","Journal of Environmental Management","Understanding farmers’ conservation behavior over time","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","4 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/RXSQF8NX/Doran et al. - 2022 - Understanding farmers’ conservation behavior over .pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/5DCQ7LCM/S0301479722017091.html","","sesync acknowledgment; Pursuit; T:Social Science; T:Psychology; F:Land & Human Dynamics; reported to NSF; T:Agriculture; T:Forests, Grasslands, & Other Terrestrial Lands; Year 8; 2018C19-020; T:Methods & Methodology; 2022; F:Food Systems & the Environment; K:Best management practices; K:Water quality; K:Harmful algal blooms; K:Cover crops; K:Farmer behavior change; K:Water-food nexus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, freshwater recreational fisheries are characterized as complex adaptive social-ecological systems (SESs). Subsequently, two interrelated frameworks, drawing on the Ostrom framework for the analysis of SESs and adaptive management as key foundations, are presented. These frameworks are useful to structure the complexity and apprehend the various feedbacks and links inherent in any particular recreational fisheries system. Moreover, the frameworks help to identify operational management strategies in the face of substantial social-ecological uncertainty. It is concluded that to understand and manage freshwater recreational fisheries as complex adaptive SESs, a sustained shift from disciplinary to inter- and sometimes transdisciplinary research as well as a focus on flexible, adaptive and generally enabling rather than command-and-control type governance and management are needed. Understanding and managing recreational fisheries as complex adaptive SESs will benefit from an increasing focus on (i) managing social-ecological feedbacks and processes, (ii) managing critical slow variables that either drive the system or maintain it in potentially undesirable states, and (iii) managing and maintaining social and ecological diversity. It is hoped that the frameworks presented in this article may guide future interdisciplinary inquiry to manage for sustainability by building resilience.","2017-01","2020-11-17 20:35:17","2023-12-07 17:41:58","","1–41","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","129 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: Taylor & Francis","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/8PSD2XUG/23308249.2016.html","","T:Resilience; 2017; no acknowledgment; Foundation; T:Theoretical/Conceptual Frameworks; F:Water & People; F:Governance & Natural Resources; Year 3; T:Fisheries; 2014F-007; K:recreational fisheries; K:heterogeneity; K:scale; K:complex systems; K:regime shift; K:Angling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of environmental flows provides a framework for improving understanding of relationships between river flows and people, and for supporting those that are mutually beneficial. Nevertheless, most approaches to determining environmental flows remain grounded in the biophysical sciences. The newly revised Brisbane Declaration and Global Action Agenda on Environmental Flows (2018) represents a new phase in environmental flow science and an opportunity to better consider the co‐constitution of river flows, ecosystems, and society, and to more explicitly incorporate these relationships into river management. We synthesize understanding of relationships between people and rivers as conceived under the renewed definition of environmental flows. We present case studies from Honduras, India, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia that illustrate multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts where recognizing and meeting diverse flow needs of human populations was central to establishing environmental flow recommendations. We also review a small body of literature to highlight examples of the diversity and interdependencies of human‐flow relationships—such as the linkages between river flow and human well‐being, spiritual needs, cultural identity, and sense of place—that are typically overlooked when environmental flows are assessed and negotiated. Finally, we call for scientists and water managers to recognize the diversity of ways of knowing, relating to, and utilizing rivers, and to place this recognition at the center of future environmental flow assessments.","2019-09","2020-11-17 20:34:35","2023-12-07 17:41:58","","","","6","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","113 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Socio-Environmental Systems; Postdoc; 2019; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; Workshop; F:Actionable Research; Year 6; F:Water & People; 2016PF-025; K:freshwater; K:environmental flows; 2016W-061; K:allocations; Year 6 (AR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This omission limits the validity of their findings and may undermine the ‘science-based' decisions they inform. We summarize and analyze seven commonly perceived challenges to conducting uncertainty assessment that help explain why it often receives superficial treatment in ES studies. We connect these challenges to solutions in relevant scientific literature and guidance documents. Since ES science is based on a multiplicity of disciplines (e.g., ecology, hydrology, economics, environmental modeling, policy sciences), substantial knowledge already exists to identify, quantify, and communicate uncertainties. The integration of these disciplines for solution-oriented modeling has been the focus of the integrated assessment community for many years, and we argue that many insights and best practices from this field can be directly used to improve ES assessments. We also recognize a number of issues that hinder the adoption of uncertainty assessment as part of standard practice. Our synthesis provides a starting point for ES analysts and other applied modelers looking for further guidance on uncertainty assessment and helps scientists and decision-makers to set reasonable expectations for characterizing the level of confidence associated with an ES assessment.","2017-04","2020-11-17 20:35:13","2023-12-07 17:41:57","","1–15","","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","117 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","/Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/M886WKZ9/Hamel and Bryant - 2017 - Uncertainty assessment in ecosystem services analy.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/GD2BAV97/Hamel and Bryant - 2017 - Uncertainty assessment in ecosystem services analy.pdf; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/KJMGYF7S/S221204161630359X.html; /Users/nah093/Zotero/storage/JNT8ZVFX/S221204161630359X.html","","2017; no acknowledgment; Year 5; F:Ecosystem Services; Workshop; T:Ecosystem Services/Functions; T:Methods & Methodology; T:Modeling; K:Integrated assessment and modeling; 2016W-055","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review principles of social cognition and decision making that shape and constrain how environmental governance systems adapt. We focus primarily on the interplay between key decision makers in society and legal systems. We argue that adaptive governance must overcome three cooperative dilemmas to facilitate adaptation: (1) encouraging collaborative problem solving, (2) garnering social acceptance and commitment, and (3) cultivating a culture of trust and tolerance for change and uncertainty. However, to do so governance systems must cope with biases in people’s decision making that cloud their judgment and create conflict. These systems must also satisfy people’s fundamental needs for self-determination, fairness, and security, ensuring that changes to environmental governance are perceived as legitimate, trustworthy, and acceptable. We discuss the implications of these principles for common governance solutions (e.g., public participation, enforcement) and conclude with methodological recommendations. We outline how scholars can investigate the social cognitive principles involved in cases of adaptive governance.","2017-03","2020-11-17 20:35:15","2023-12-07 17:41:57","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; 2017; Pursuit; T:Social Science; T:Climate Change; Year 2; F:Governance & Natural Resources; K:environmental law; T:Governance & Decision Making; T:Human Rights, Security, & Environmental Justice; K:cooperation; 2013T5-006; K:legitimacy; K:cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In six urbanizing watersheds surrounding three U.S. cities (Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, and Pittsburgh, PA), we reconstructed the history of development patterns since 1900 and assessed the magnitude and timing of stream flow changes during watershed development. Development reconstructions indicated that the majority of watershed development occurred during a period of peak population growth, typically between 1950 and 1970. Stream flow records indicated significant increases in annual frequency of high-flow events in all six watersheds and increases in annual runoff efficiency in five watersheds. Annual development intensity during the peak growth period had the strongest association with the magnitude of changes in high-flow frequency from the pre- to post-development periods. Results suggest the timing of the peak growth period is particularly important to understanding hydrologic changes, because it can set the type of stormwater infrastructure installed within a watershed. In three watersheds there was a rapid (∼10-15 years) shift toward more frequent high-flow events, and in four watersheds there was a shift toward higher runoff efficiency. Breakpoint analyses indicated these shifts occurred between 1969 and 1976 for high-flow frequency and between 1962 and 1984 for runoff efficiency. Results indicated that the timing of high-flow changes were mainly driven by the development trajectory of each watershed, whereas the timing of runoff-efficiency changes were driven by a combination of development trajectories and extreme weather events. Our results underscore the need to refine the causes of urban stream degradation to incorporate the impact of gradual versus rapid urbanization on hydrologic changes and aquatic ecosystem function, as well as to recognize that the dominant drivers of hydrologic changes are heterogeneous among urban watersheds and vary over time.","2015-06","2020-11-17 20:35:18","2023-12-07 17:41:57","","000056","","0","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07] Publisher: University of California Press","","","","Year 4; F:Built Environment; no acknowledgment; T:Urban Planning & Green Infrastructure; 2015; Postdoc; T:Lakes, Rivers, Streams, & Wetlands; F:Water & People; K:watershed; K:hydrologic alteration; 2014PF-013; K:Development; K:stream flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basic idea of brokerage is that the central actor or ‘broker' benefits from spanning the gap (or structural hole) between two disconnected parties. However, it is not always advantageous to limit the systems studied to only one mode. We develop an operationalization of two-mode brokerage in which we can classify the structures according to the heterogeneity of the types of actors involved. We apply this conception to water policy networks in the San Joaquin–Sacramento River Delta in California where two-mode networks represent organizations participating in multiple policy institutions. The potential benefits of brokerage are high in these types of fragmented systems where multiple institutions and organizations are involved with policy decisions. Of particular interest is the role of collaborative partnership institutions, which are hypothesized to broker the most heterogeneous structures. We use our two-mode version of brokerage to construct a scale of brokerage from most homogeneous to most heterogeneous. This scale lets us categorize both the role of these collaborative partnerships as well as the nature of brokerage in the system overall.","2015-05","2020-11-17 20:35:19","2023-12-07 17:41:57","","36–47","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","56 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-07]","","","","sesync acknowledgment; T:Social Science; 2015; Postdoc; T:Methods & Methodology; F:Water & People; T:Policy & Regulation; F:Governance & Natural Resources; T:Governance & Decision Making; Year 3; 2013PF-007; K:network analysis; K:Baseline models; K:Two-mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet the extent to which transnational agricultural large-scale land acquisitions (TALSLAs) contribute to—or merely correlate with—deforestation, and the expected biodiversity impacts of the intended land use changes across ecosystems, remains unclear. We examine 178 georeferenced TALSLA locations in 40 countries to address this gap. While forest cover within TALSLAs decreased by 17% between 2000 and 2018 and became more fragmented, the spatio-temporal patterns of deforestation varied substantially across regions. While deforestation rates within initially forested TALSLAs were 1.5 (Asia) to 2 times (Africa) higher than immediately surrounding areas, we detected no such difference in Europe and Latin America. Our findings suggest that, whereas TALSLAs may have accelerated forest loss in Asia, a different mechanism might emerge in Africa where TALSLAs target areas already experiencing elevated deforestation. Regarding biodiversity (here focused on vertebrate species), we find that nearly all (91%) studied deals will likely experience substantial losses in relative species richness (−14.1% on average within each deal)—with mixed outcomes for relative abundance—due to the intended land use transitions. We also find that 39% of TALSLAs fall at least partially within biodiversity hotspots, placing these areas at heightened risk of biodiversity loss. Taken together, these findings suggest distinct regional differences in the nature of the association between TALSLAs and forest loss and provide new evidence of TALSLAs as an emerging threat to biodiversity in the Global South.","2023-02","2023-02-07 14:05:12","2023-12-07 17:41:56","2023-02-07 14:05:12","024014","","2","18","","Environ.
