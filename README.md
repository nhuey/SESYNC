This repository contains the working files and R code used to clean and perform analyses on the SESYNC data from the University of Maryland

There are files in the archive which were used for initial data pulling/cleaning/processing. These are mostly saved in case of need and are not maintained/well-commented. 

The most up-to-date data file is SESYNC - Jan19.xlsx. Some further edits are done in the main analysis file, SESYNC_Analyses_2.R.

Other files in the main repo are used for various stages of the analysis.

Ongoing work is happening to split the master analysis file into subfiles for easier use.
